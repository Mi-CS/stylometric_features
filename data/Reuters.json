Geneva-based International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) on Wednesday appealed for food aid for flood-hit North Korea, predicting disaster by the end of the year if relief did not arrive.\n\"The country is running out of food...they are emptying their warehouses now,\" Ole Gronning of Denmark, IFRC representative in North Korea, said in an interview in Beijing.\n\"We will have a human disaster at the end of the year if the food (aid) is not coming,\" said Gronning, who had been in North Korea since last November. \"(By) July...there will be no food in the country.\"\nDevastating floods in 1995 and 1996 left half a million North Koreans homeless out of a total of 23 million, according to relief organisations.\nThe floods have struck hard at the economy of the hermit communist state, destroying rice fields, roads, factories and livestock and swamping mines.\nNorth Korea was forecast to consume 5.5 million tonnes of grain in 1997, but Pyongyang feared a shortfall of 45 percent, or up to 2.5 million tonnes, Gronning said.\n\"We already now know that the harvest will not be successful...,\" he said.\nOn Monday, North Korea admitted that it had only half the grain needed to feed its people.\nFood rations across North Korea had dropped to less than a quarter of the level normally considered essential to maintain a healthy population, Gronning said.\nThere was no indication yet of famine but grain rations had been cut to 100 grams (3.5 ounces) per person a day -- equivalent to 900 calories -- from 450 grams (15.9 ounces).\n\"Signs of malnutrition are there,\" he said.\nThe IFRC aimed to raise $10 million to feed 139,000 of the worst hit victims for 11 months through October this year, but so far only $1 million had been raised, Gronning said.\nAbout 5.2 million North Koreans were directly affected by the 1995 floods and a further 3.3 million last year.\nTwo earlier appeals for funds totalling more than $10 million had largely been met.\nPhotographs taken by Gronning in North Korea showed what he said was arable land under one metre (yard) of sand.\nAbout two percent of North Korea's farmland had been completely destroyed, covered with sand several metres deep, Gronning said. Lack of machinery made reclamation of sand-covered arable land difficult.\nNorth Korea was \"very exposed\", he said, adding that floods and hailstorms could strike again.\nPyongyang's arch-rival South Korea has been one of the 25 donor countries, pledging 1,000 (corrects from 100,000) tonnes of wheat flour and 15,000 pairs of socks.\n\"South Korea is coming in very big this year,\" he said.\nSeoul suspended food shipments to North Korea after accusing Pyongyang of landing 26 commandos from a submarine last September. All but two of the group died during a manhunt.\nThe aid resumed after North Korea apologised and South Korea returned the remains of the infiltrators.\nIn January, the United States gave permission to Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc, the world's largest private grain trading company, to export 500,000 tonnes of wheat or rice to North Korea in what was expected to be a barter agreement.\n","1":"China was caught on Thursday in a no-win situation in a row between its old communist comrade, Pyongyang, and a new commercial ally, Seoul, with a North Korean official holed up in the South Korean embassy in Beijing.\n\"Whatever way they (the Chinese) play it... it's impossible to keep both Koreas happy,\" one Western diplomat said.\nSouth Korea said Hwang Jang-yop, a senior aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, and an assistant were seeking asylum at Seoul's embassy in Beijing.\nNorth Korea accused the South of kidnapping Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of Pyongyang's ruling Workers' Party, and urged China to sort out the mess -- in North Korea's favour.\nDiplomats said they saw little opportunity for Beijing to settle the row in its backyard without disappointing the Stalinist North, one of China's few remaining socialist allies.\n\"The inevitable outcome is that the guy will end up in Seoul. I can't see any way around it,\" a second diplomat said.\nDiplomats said they expected some tough negotiations on the crisis, with Hwang possibly locked inside the South Korean compound for some time.\nSouth Korea has sent Kim Ha-jung, a special adviser to Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha, to Beijing for talks on the defector's fate.\nIf South Korea can convince China that Hwang sought asylum of his own free will and was not kidnapped, China has little choice but to allow the defector to leave for South Korea, the diplomats said.\nAlready Beijing was giving a hint of its position.\nChinese police blocked the sedate, tree-lined avenues leading to South Korea's consular office in Beijing, where Hwang arrived by taxi on Wednesday to seek asylum.\nThe cordon was protection for the compound and its high-profile guest against possible North Korean intrusions rather than to prevent the apparent defector from leaving China, diplomats said.\n\"The Chinese will play it according to the rules,\" the second Western diplomat said. \"They won't stick their nose into the embassy itself. That's something they'll never do.\n\"It (the cordon) could be as much for the protection of the South Koreans as anything else because the North Koreans could do anything,\" he said. \"You'd want to make sure there are no untoward incidents.\"\nHwang, 73, was the highest ranking Pyongyang official to seek asylum in South Korea. He was in charge of the North Korean communist party's foreign policy and a member of its powerful central committee, said Seoul officials, who rank him 24th in the Pyongyang power structure.\nBut Beijing must placate North Korea, whose friendship China once described as being as close as \"lips and teeth\".\n\"They'll have to find some face-saving way to resolve the problem,\" the second diplomat said.\n\"They (Chinese) turned a blind eye in the past to defections through China and that may become a lot more difficult from now on,\" he said.\nChina has called for calm in the interests of peace and stability in the Korean peninsula while it investigates.\nNorth and South Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953. China fought on North Korea's side in the conflict.\nBut capitalist South Korea has become an important trading partner and source of investment for China in recent years.\n\"There's far more in the relationship with South Korea for China than... with North Korea,\" the first diplomat said.\n\"China's primary interest in North Korea is that the country doesn't collapse with refugees flooding across the border and possible nuclear problems,\" he said.\nNorth Korea was suspected in the early 1990s of pursuing a weapons-grade nuclear programme. Under an agreement signed with Washington in 1994 Pyongyang promised to dismantle the programme in return for safer light-water reactors.\n","2":"Chinese police have arrested the suspected ringleader of a riot in the mainly Moslem northwestern region of Xinjiang last week that left at least 10 people dead and 144 injured, local officials said on Wednesday.\nAbudu Heilili, 29, of the Uighur ethnic minority, was in police custody and under interrogation following the riot last Wednesday and Thursday in Yining near China's border with Kazakhstan, said a local Communist Party committee official.\nThe suspect was unemployed, and was a ringleader of a less violent anti-Chinese demonstration in Yining in August 1995, the official told Reuters by telephone.\nHeilili had been released after that demonstration following \"ideological education\" -- a codeword for political indoctrination, he said.\nPolice rounded up 200 to 300 people after last week's riot, in which at least 10 people were killed and 144 injured. Many suspects had been released after questioning, officials said.\nThe death toll could rise, with up to seven people listed as missing, the party official said. About 90 people were treated for head wounds, and more than 10 were still in hospital.\nOf the injured, 132 were civilians while the remaining 12 were members of the paramilitary People's Armed Police, a spokesman for the Xinjiang regional government said by telephone from Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital.\nAuthorities had issued circulars calling on local officials to deal a blow to separatism in the frontier region and warning of severe punishment for last week's rioters.\n\"We are resolved to deal a blow to the handful of ethnic separatist elements,\" said Zhang Youlian, deputy director of foreign affairs office for the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, that administers Yining.\nAbout 1,000 people, mostly Uighur farmers or unemployed young men, rioted in Yining last week in one of the largest and most violent demonstrations for independence in the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang since the 1949 communist takeover.\nTurkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority in Xinjiang, where ethnic Han Chinese make up 38 percent of the population.\n\"We don't want the Communist Party,\" the demonstrators had chanted, witnesses said.\nUighur demonstrators had attacked Han Chinese with bricks, clubs and knives, and rampaged through the town, smashing and setting fire to about 20 vehicles and looting shops.\nThe People's Armed Police only succeeded in dispersing the rioters a day later, firing teargas to break up the crowd.\nAuthorities had sealed off Yining, an after-dark curfew was in force in some districts and armed police still patrolled the streets. The airport would reopen on Friday, officials said.\nA Chinese source said the riot erupted after a Uighur criminal suspect resisted arrest by police.\nYusupbek Mukhlisi, leader of the United National Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan based in Kazakhstan, said the riot was sparked by the execution of 30 Uighurs in China last week. Chinese officials dismissed the report.\nYining is 50 km (30 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan, where many exiled Uighur separatists live.\nXinjiang authorities last year stepped up a crackdown on separatists and underground religious activity after clashes, bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.\nLast May, Beijing ordered tighter controls along Xinjiang's lengthy border to block the smuggling of weapons and subversive materials from nearby central Asian states.\n","3":"China said on Friday that Taiwan was a pawn and toy of hostile Western forces out to weaken and divide the country and thwart its development.\n\"Taiwan...acts as a pawn of international anti-Chinese forces, a toy in the hands of others,\" said a front-page commentary in the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper.\nThe commentary, issued to mark the 25th anniversary of Beijing's ousting of Taipei from the United Nations, accused Taiwan of collaborating with forces hostile towards China to try to regain admission to the world body.\n\"Some Western forces have ceaselessly played the 'human rights card', 'Tibet card' to limit China's development,\" the commentary said.\n\"They see the Taiwan issue as one of their trump cards -- an important means of weakening and dividing China,\" it said without naming any countries but implying the United States.\nIn September, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a non-binding resolution supporting Taiwan's efforts to rejoin the United Nations, enraging Beijing.\nChina, which regards Taiwan as a rebel province, maintains that the issue was settled once and for all in 1971 when Taipei was replaced by Beijing at the United Nations.\nThe commentary said countries that have helped Taiwan with its bid to regain admission to the United Nations were shortsighted like \"rats which can only see an inch in front of their eyes\".\nIt urged Taiwan's allies, mainly Central American, African and Caribbean countries, to stop \"foolish activities in the interest of others\".\nFor the fourth consecutive year, China and its supporters blocked moves in the General Assembly in September to consider U.N. membership for wealthy but diplomatically isolated Taiwan.\nChina considers any move to give Taiwan U.N. membership an encroachment on its sovereignty and an interference in its internal affairs.\nBeijing and Taipei have been diplomatic rivals since Mao Zedong's Red Army defeated Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists and forced them to flee to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.\nBeijing's communist rulers have sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation to force it into reunification. Almost 160 countries recognise Beijing, while 30 have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.\nBoth communist Beijing and capitalist Taipei agree to reunify one day, albeit on different terms. China has threatened to invade if the island declares independence.\nThe commentary said Taiwan's offer to give $1.0 billion to the United Nations on admission into the world body had become an \"international joke\".\nIt jeered at the argument that Taiwan deserved a seat as it was now democratic and economically prosperous, saying the island was \"deceiving others and itself\".\n\"No matter what political system Taiwan implemented or what level of economic development it attained...regaining admission to the United Nations would be purely a dream,\" it said.\n","4":"China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is in good health, but may not be able to visit Hong Kong when the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in mid-1997, Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa said on Monday.\n\"To my knowledge, (his health) is very good,\" Zhang told reporters when asked about Deng's health at a reception for diplomats and foreign journalists in Beijing.\nZhang, who is believed to be close to the Deng family, said he had not recently visited the 92-year-old architect of China's sweeping economic reforms, but said Deng was in Beijing.\nAsked if Deng would visit Hong Kong for the ceremony when Beijing resumes sovereignty over the British colony at midnight on June 30, 1997, Zhang said: \"He said it himself -- he will go to Hong Kong even it means in a wheelchair.\"\nBut Zhang added: \"It would be difficult for him to go now. It would be disastrous for an old man in his 90s to catch cold. Catching cold would be a serious illness.\"\nDeng oversaw the negotiations that successfully concluded in an agreement for Britain to hand back the territory it has held for 150 years. He has said repeatedly he hoped to be able to witness the historic transfer of power.\nChinese officials have said privately that Deng would not attend the handover ceremony, where his anointed successor President Jiang Zemin is expected to hold the limelight, but they hoped he would be able to visit Hong Kong afterwards.\nThe man who launched China's sweeping market-oriented economic reforms in 1978 and guided the nation's policies during the 1980s and into the early 1990s no longer holds public office but remains highly influential.\nHe has not been seen in public since early 1994 when he toured Shanghai during Chinese Lunar New Year festivities and appeared frail and halting in his movements and had difficulty speaking.\nDeng's health is a matter of intense speculation in China and in neighbouring countries because his death is expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as the de facto emperor of the world's most populous nation.\nBut analysts say that his death has largely been discounted and rumours of his ill-health that just 18 months ago sent Asian markets into a tailspin now generate little more than a murmur.\nDeng is said to be suffering from Parkinson's disease. It is believed that he rarely leaves his closely-guarded home in a courtyard in central Beijing just behind the Forbidden City where China's emperors had ruled for centuries. Beijing has clamped an effective blackout on news about the health of the man who guided China out of the years of radical revolution espoused by Mao, dismantled much of 40 years of Stalinist-style central planning and told Chinese that \"to get rich is glorious\".\nOfficials routinely decline to answer questions about Deng's health, giving the party line that: \"He is as well as can be expected for a man of his age.\"\nHowever, sources close to the family say Deng is losing his ability to walk and is believed to spend most of his time in a wheelchair.\n","5":"China's Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin appears to be making all the right moves to shore up his position to retain power after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, diplomats and analysts said on Friday.\nJiang has declared war on corruption, crime and poverty -- scourges that have plagued China for centuries and led to the downfall of many a dynasty.\nIn his latest move, he used the party's four-day, annual closed-door plenum that ended in Beijing on Thursday to resurrect ideological puritanism -- spiritual civilisation -- which has been eroded by nearly two decades of economic reforms.\nWhether Jiang would be able to stave off challenges from rivals in the party and cling to power in the post-Deng era hinged in part on the crucial 15th party congress to be held in late 1997, diplomats and analysts said.\nThe party's political heavyweights will be jockeying for position in the run-up to next year's congress, a five-yearly opportunity for reshuffles in the party's powerful Politburo and its yet more influential standing committee.\nChinese sources say the Communist Party is debating a plan to revive the post of chairman and to create one or two vice chairman positions -- one of which could be given to Premier Li Peng, a loose ally of Jiang whose term ends in 1998.\nLi is required by the constitution to step down as premier in 1998 after serving two six-year terms and is keen to find another job to remain in the top echelons of power.\nArmed with the weapon of spiritual civilisation -- communist jargon for toeing the party line -- Jiang is battling to avoid the fate of his two predecessors, analysts said.\nHu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang were sacked from the party's general secretary post in 1987 and 1989 respectively because their \"grip on material civilisation was tight but their grip on spiritual civilisation was loose\", one Chinese analyst said.\n\"They did not pay enough attention to ensuring that the party's position could not be challenged...that was what brought them down,\" an Asian diplomat said of Hu and Zhao.\nA plenum communique attested to Jiang's worries. \"From the start to the end, we should be resolute on tightening the grip on both,\" the plenum communique said.\n\"At no time can we sacrifice spiritual values in the name of momentary economic development,\" the communique said.\nThe spiritual civilisation campaign aims to create a communist utopia -- stamp out superstition, tighten the party's grip on media, instil politically correct values and create heroes and model workers whose orthodox Marxist behaviour the populace at large should strive to emulate.\nIt is hardly rousing stuff. But Jiang may be desperate.\nAnalysts said Jiang remained overshadowed by Deng, architect of the market-oriented economic reforms and still influential even without an official post and despite increasingly fragile health.\n\"In the midst of his great triumph, Jiang Zemin if he is all that powerful...there is no need for him to go out of his way to mention Deng Xiaoping,\" a Western diplomat said referring to the communique that tips its hat to Deng.\n\"Jiang Zemin...is still in consolidation mode...in the process of selling himself,\" he said. \"The jury is still out.\"\nJiang is eager to consolidate his power base even after amassing the three most important positions in China -- general secretary of the Communist Party, state president and chairman of party's powerful Central Military Commission.\nMany diplomats see Jiang as a transitional figure after the death of Deng, which is widely expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as the de facto emperor of the world's most populous nation.\n","6":"Chinese Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin has wooed Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties to come up with constructive suggestions on reunification of the two sides, split by civil war almost five decades ago.\n\"We welcome Taiwan's various political parties...to exchange views with us on relations between the two sides and on constructive suggestions about peaceful reunification,\" Jiang told a government advisory body on New Year's Day.\nChinese newspapers carried the full text of Jiang's speech on Thursday.\nEarlier this week, Jiang made a similar overture, but he made no mention of the island's political parties, instead referring to Taiwanese from all walks of life.\nTaiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, which fled into exile on the island after losing the Chinese civil war in 1949, says it is committed to reunification but is in no hurry to do so. Taiwan insists on reunification under freedom and democracy and a free market economy.\nThe island's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party has called for \"self-determination\", or letting Taiwan's residents decide for themselves whether to reunify or declare independence.\nChina, which regards Taiwan as a rebel province, has threatened to invade if the island declares independence.\n\"Taiwan is our country's sacred territory,\" Jiang said.\n\"We hope the Taiwanese authorities...will stop all activities splitting the motherland and take realistic action to improve relations between the two sides,\" he said.\nTensions between Beijing and Taipei began to ease in the late 1980s, but relations plunged after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a trip to the United States in a bid to break the island out of diplomatic isolation imposed by China.\nTies deteriorated further last March when China conducted war games and missile tests close to Taiwan in the run-up to the island's historic presidential elections. China frowns on Western-style democracy.\nAnalysts said Jiang was eager for reunification to secure his place in modern Chinese history alongside Mao Zedong, who established the People's Republic, and Deng Xiaoping, who cemented the return of the British colony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in mid-1997.\nJiang, the anointed successor of Deng, China's 92-year-old paramount leader, is seen by some Western analysts as merely a transitional figure and he has struggled to shake off that image.\nJiang's call on Taiwan to come up with suggestions on ways to reunify could go unanswered again, one Chinese analyst said.\nChina has been bitter since Taiwan ignored Jiang's 1995 \"eight point\" proposal on reunification, in which he called for leaders of the two sides to exchange visits.\nJiang was seen by some in the military and the Communist Party as weak after his earlier call for reunification fell on deaf ears, analysts said.\nHis latest overture to Taiwan could backfire and be used by his political opponents to attack him, another analyst said.\n","7":"A Tibetan nun has had her jail term doubled to 18 years for refusing to recognise Beijing's choice as the reincarnation of the region's second holiest monk, the Tibet Information Network (TIN) said on Monday.\nThe sentence of 19-year-old Ngawang Sangdrol, jailed since she was 15, was doubled in July, partly because she refused to accept Beijing's choice as the Panchen Lama, according to the London-based TIN, which monitors human rights in the Himalayan region.\n\"Ngawang...is now facing (more time) in jail than any other female political prisoner in Tibet,\" TIN said. She is due for release in the year 2010.\nOfficials reached by telephone in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa denied knowledge of the report.\nThe 10th Panchen Lama died in 1989, and Beijing has anointed a six-year-old boy as his reincarnation.\nThe Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, has named another six-year-old boy as the 11th Panchen Lama, and many Tibetans see the Beijing-backed child as a pretender.\nBeijing's choice is in the Chinese capital under state protection against any possible assassination attempts by radical Tibetans, Chinese sources have said.\nChina denies there are political prisoners in Tibet and says foreign critics of its human rights record are interfering in its internal affairs.\nNgawang is already serving nine years -- three years for taking part in a pro-independence demonstration in 1992 and six years for singing nationalist songs in prison in 1993, according to TIN.\nHer sentence was doubled in part because she refused to tidy her cell in Lhasa's Drapchi prison in March in apparent protest against a political re-education campaign, TIN said.\nThe campaign is designed to force prisoners to accept Beijing's choice as the reincarnated Panchen Lama.\nNgawang also refused to stand up in the presence of a Tibetan official, Brigade Commander Khandrol Jangpe, TIN said.\nThe human rights group, which had reported in August that Ngawang was on a restricted diet and confined in a cell with no windows, said it had only recently received confirmation of the longer jail term through a former prisoner who fled Tibet.\nChina has vowed to curb the influence of Buddhism and the Dalai Lama in Tibet, saying socialism must take precedence over religion.\nThe Dalai Lama, the most revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism, fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland.\nState media have complained that monks and nuns outnumber high school students and that too much money was spent on the region's monasteries.\n","8":"China's Supreme Court announced on Thursday that a court has rejected the appeal of a son of one of the country's political elite, upholding a suspended death sentence for bribery.\nThe appellate court showed leniency because Zhou Beifang, 43, former chairman of Hong Kong-listed affiliates of the giant state-owned Capital Iron and Steel Corp (Shougang), showed remorse, the Xinhua news agency said, quoting the Supreme Court.\nChinese courts frequently impose the death penalty in corruption cases but as Zhou's death sentence was suspended for two years it could be commuted to life imprisonment by the time it was due to be carried out, as is often the case in China.\nZhou is one of China's so-called \"princelings\", the popular sobriquet applied to the children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence.\nThe Zhou family has close ties to the family of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\nThe appellate court also showed leniency because Zhou voluntarily returned ill-gotten wealth during the investigation even before prosecutors obtained evidence against him, Xinhua said.\nZhou was convicted of accepting bribes totalling 9.28 million Hong Kong dollars ($1.2 million) between June 1993 and April 1994, Xinhua said. It gave no details of who paid Zhou the bribes or why.\nHe was also found guilty of paying 1.2 million yuan ($144,600) in bribes to three people, including two former officials of the Beijing city government, so that his wife and daughter could move to the British colony, it said.\nXinhua did not say when Zhou appealed, when he was first convicted or why the Beijing Higher People's Court rejected his appeal.\nCourt officials reached by telephone declined to comment.\nZhou's conviction was part of a highly-publicised anti-graft campaign launched by China last year.\nThe drive led to the suicide of a Beijing vice-mayor in April 1995 and the fall of his mentor, former Beijing Communist Party boss Chen Xitong.\nZhou's father, Zhou Guanwu, 78, resigned as chairman and Communist Party secretary of Shougang in February 1995, citing old age following Zhou Beifang's detention.\nShougang has been restructured since Zhou Guanwu's downfall.\nThe appellate court also rejected the appeal of co-defendant Chen Jian, 39, a former senior official of the Beijing city government, and upheld his 15-year prison sentence for accepting bribes from Zhou, Xinhua said.\nAnother former official of the Beijing city government, Li Min, did not appeal against his sentence of life imprisonment also for accepting bribes from Zhou, the agency said.\nThe appeal of a fourth defendant who was sentenced to 16 years was rejected while a fifth defendant who was given five years in prison did not appeal, it said.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.\n","9":"The mother of detained Chinese dissident Wang Dan said on Monday she would defend her son in court against the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government.\n\"Two defence counsels are allowed...I will be one of them,\" Wang Lingyun, a 61-year-old researcher at a museum who has no background in law, told Reuters in an interview.\n\"Wang Dan also wants me to defend him,\" she said. Chinese laws allow accused to be defended by family members.\nA court spokeswoman confirmed Wang Dan, 26, had been charged with plotting to overthrow the government but declined to give further details.\nWang Dan's mother said the court had yet to inform her of the trial date, but said it could come as early as this week.\nShe said she would defend her son against the charge of collaborating with overseas subversive forces.\n\"This charge does not stand up,\" she said, adding that Wang Dan had only taken a correspondence course at the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States.\n\"It has nothing to do with politics. I was the one who wanted him to attend the course...It has nothing to do with overthrowing the government,\" she said.\nAsked to comment on the chances of winning, she said: \"I'm not optimistic. But I must say it for the record. This will become history.\"\nRelatives said last week they had found a lawyer willing to defend Wang after being given one day to find one.\nThe lawyer retained by the family would defend the dissident against other charges in the indictment.\nWang Dan, former leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations, has been charged with the capital offence of plotting to subvert the government, based on evidence such as writings critical of the state and accepting funds from abroad.\nHe was detained by police in a raid on his home in May 1995, but was not formally arrested or charged until last week.\nOn Friday, the family obtained a copy of the bill of indictment, which accused Wang Dan of plotting to subvert the government, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death. The minimum sentence is 10 years, although the court can show leniency if it finds extenuating circumstances.\nWang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in the 1989 demonstrations centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, which were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life.\nWang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng of plotting to overthrow the government also implicated the former student leader.\nThe court's verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people \"convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan\". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.\nWang had been active since his release from jail, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.\n","10":"Chinese authorities sealed off a town in northwestern Xinjiang and paramilitary police patrolled the streets after at least 10 people were killed in a separatist riot last week, residents said on Tuesday.\n\"No one can leave, no one can enter,\" one resident said by telephone from the mainly Moslem town of Yining in the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture near the border with Kazakhstan.\nAuthorities closed the airport and railway station on Thursday and clamped an after-dark curfew on the town, residents said.\nAt least 10 people were killed, including one policeman, and some 100 wounded when 1,000 Moslem separatists of the Uighur ethnic minority rampaged through Yining on Wednesday to protest against Beijing rule, Chinese sources and residents have said.\nThe riot was among the most violent for many years in the restive region of Xinjiang, where Turkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority and ethnic Han Chinese make up 38 percent of the population.\nShops and restaurants were closed in Yining and paramilitary police patrolled the streets. Police had arrested many suspects and were hunting other rioters, one Han woman resident said.\nHundreds of Uighurs had been arrested following the riot, said the leader of an exiled nationalist Uighur group in Kazakhstan in an interview in Almaty.\nLocal officials said the number of arrests was much lower, but refused to give further details.\n\"They have arrested several counter-revolutionaries and they are catching more,\" the woman resident said.\n\"The Uighurs are walking the streets and they look happy because the streets are full of them,\" she said in a sign of the depth of ethnic divisions. \"It's just them in the streets. It's all their people. No one else is on the streets.\"\nHowever, Han residents said they were not afraid.\n\"We are not nervous because the armed police and police are here,\" the woman said.\n\"If something happens we will...unite,\" another Han resident said. \"There are also patriots among the Uighurs.\"\nOfficials tried to play down the riot, describing it as a small incident fuelled by \"foreign hostile forces\". They refused to say how many people were killed or wounded.\nYining is 50 km (30 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan, where many exiled Uighur separatists live.\nIn Almaty, Yusupbek Mukhlisi, leader of the United National Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan, said the riot was sparked by the execution of 30 Uighurs by the authorities last week.\nHowever, an official of the bureau in charge of directing the clean-up operation after the riot denied that report.\n\"This is a pure fabrication,\" he said. \"But I cannot tell you the reason.\"\nThe rioters attacked Han Chinese on sight, smashed cars and set fire to shops, forcing authorities to mobilise 1,000 police and paramilitary People's Armed Police to quell the violence, witnesses said. Police fired teargas to disperse the crowd.\nThe demonstrators, shouting anti-Chinese slogans, had marched on a government building, one official said.\nThe riot erupted after a Uighur criminal suspect resisted arrest by Chinese police, a Chinese source said.\nXinjiang authorities last year stepped up a crackdown on separatists and underground religious activity after clashes, bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.\nLast May, Beijing ordered tighter controls along Xinjiang's lengthy border to block the smuggling of weapons and subversive materials from nearby central Asian states.\n","11":"China's parliament, eager to shed its rubber stamp image, has vowed to crack down on lawless officials by intensifying supervision of the government's executive and judicial branches.\nTian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress, had conceded that the problem of officials disregarding the law was very serious in some departments, major newspapers said on Friday.\n\"Some officials are not strict when implementing the law and do not investigate legal violations,\" Tian told the opening of a nine-day seminar in the booming southern city of Shenzhen on Thursday.\n\"These phenomena are very serious in some regions and departments,\" said Tian, a member of the ruling Communist Party's 19-member Politburo.\nOfficial media frequently carry reports of abuse of power by local officials, who run their areas of jurisdiction as virtual fiefdoms. The word of an official is often taken as law.\n\"Some officials go as far as to replace the law with their word,\" Tian said. \"There are laws but some officials do not do things according to the law.\n\"Some use power to suppress the law, those enforcing the law break the law and some take the law into their own hands.\"\nSome Chinese analysts saw Tian's remarks as an attempt to increase the say of parliament in Chinese politics.\nTian and his mentor, Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress, who sits on the party's omnipotent seven-member Standing Committee, have moved in recent years to boost the status of parliament.\nTian urged lawmaking bodies at all levels to step up supervision of the executive and judicial branches.\n\"Supervision is a very weak link of the work of the People's Congress,\" Tian said.\nHe urged all lawmakers to conscientiously supervise trials and the work of the government, prosecutors and police.\nLast month, a court took 10 minutes to reject the appeal of dissident and former student leader Wang Dan and uphold an 11-year jail term for conspiring to subvert the government.\nAnother dissident, Chen Longde, attempted suicide in August by jumping from a third-floor window because he could no longer stand beating by guards at a labour camp, his family has said.\nThe labour camp denies any wrongdoing.\nChen, who broke his right leg and smashed three teeth, has been discharged from hospital and sent back to the labour camp, where he is serving three years of re-education through labour for sending a petition to parliament demanding the release of all political prisoners.\nRe-education through labour is a form of administrative punishment that can be imposed by authorities without recourse to prosecutors or the courts.\nWestern human rights activists say the punishment is increasingly favoured by the authorities as a way of removing dissidents from circulation without the complications and publicity of a trial.\n","12":"China's breakaway Catholic Church has ordained about 50 graduates of one of the country's biggest seminaries into the priesthood this year, clergy at the seminary said on Monday.\nThe new priests, five of whom were ordained on Sunday, were the first group of clergymen installed by the National Catholic Seminary since 1991, they said.\nThe officially authorised seminary in Beijing did not accept any new students for six years from 1986 due to a lack of funds and space, the clergymen said.\n\"It's a big problem. Funds are too limited,\" a priest surnamed Meng told Reuters by telephone.\nThe seminary receives 10,000 yuan ($1,200) a year from the government, or one-sixth of its annual budget, another priest said. It raises the rest from donations.\nFather Meng, who graduated in 1991, said there was no shortage of youths, many of them poor, who wanted to become priests.\nHe and other priests denied that government pressure had played a role in the lack of new students between 1986 and 1991.\nCatholics in communist China are allowed to worship openly only if they belong to the state-sponsored Catholic Patriotic Association.\nThe association, which supervises the national seminary, appoints its own bishops and does not recognise the Pope as universal Catholic leader.\nThe official church has the blessings of the Communist Party but it too must walk a fine line between the demands of the party elite and the needs of the faithful.\nThe Washington-based Human Rights Watch\/Asia has said Beijing has been stepping up harassment of unauthorised Catholic and Protestant groups in recent years.\nThe group said the crackdown on Christians included stricter controls on contacts with foreigners and was part of a broader drive begun in 1994 against all forms of religion as well as political dissent.\nBishop Zong Huaide of the state-backed church ordained five graduates of the seminary on Sunday. Zong delivered mass at the Church of the Holy Saviour, built in 1703, which was packed with about 3,000 people.\nChina has 31 seminaries and about 1,100 priests, 700 of whom are state-anointed young men.\nThe official Catholic Church in China counts four million members, while the underground church is believed to have several million members.\nVatican relations with Beijing have alternately cooled and warmed over the decades since the late 1950s, when links were severed over the Vatican's recognition of Taiwan.\nChina has said it will not normalise relations until the Vatican severs its ties with Taiwan, which Beijing has regarded as a rebel province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.\nThe Vatican, on the other hand, has demanded recognition of the Pope's primacy before it renews ties with China.\n","13":"One of China's most prominent dissidents, Wang Dan, will likely receive a harsh sentence for the charge of plotting to overthrow the government, his mother said on Tuesday.\nWang would plead not guilty to the capital charge when his trial at the Beijing Intermediate People's Court begins on Wednesday, said the dissident's mother, Wang Lingyun.\n\"The court...giving my son a harsh sentence even though he is innocent is very likely to happen,\" Wang Lingyun told Reuters. \"I dare not rule it out.\"\nShe said court officials told her the verdict could be delivered as early as Wednesday or in two days, adding that family members have been under surveillance in recent weeks.\nWang Dan, 26, who vanished into detention in May 1995, faces a minimum of 10 years in prison and a maximum penalty of death for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government.\nThe court has refused to give details of Wang's trial other than that the dissident has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government. But one official has said Wang could appeal to the Higher People's Court if convicted.\nThe New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of an acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.\nThe dissident's family has found a lawyer willing to defend the former student leader after being given just one day in which to do so.\nThe human rights group said Chinese criminal trials seldom respect the presumption of innocence, and defence lawyers are generally restricted to arguing mitigating circumstances for a reduced sentence.\nWang's court appearance would likely be held out of the public eye, as was last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.\nThe Chinese authorities have been quiet on a request by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to send observers to Wang's trial, diplomats said.\nFrench senator Robert Badinter, former U.S. attorneys general Nicholas Katzenback and Richard Thornburgh, and former Canadian solicitor-general Warren Allmand have also said they want to observe Wang's trial.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang on Tuesday shrugged off questions from reporters about the status of the requests, saying Wang's trial was China's internal affairs.\nBeijing has repeatedly come under fire from the West for human rights abuses. It says foreign intervention in China's internal affairs is not welcomed.\nWang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in.\nThe mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health has deteriorated during his detention.\nWang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nHe was active after his parole in 1993, defying persistent police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.\nChina has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.\n","14":"China demanded on Monday that the United States cancel plans to sell Stinger missiles, launchers and other weapons to Taiwan to prevent \"new damage\" to slowly recovering Sino-U.S. relations.\n\"We ask the U.S. side...to cancel plans to sell missiles to Taiwan to prevent creating new damage to Sino-U.S. relations,\" a Foreign Ministry spokesman told Reuters.\nBeijing has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since the end of the civil war in 1949. It opposes the sale of weapons to the island.\nThe United States should take Sino-U.S. relations into account and live up to its promise regarding the sale of weapons to Taiwan, the spokesman said without elaborating. Washington has agreed to reduce weapons sales to Taiwan.\nRejecting a similar demand by China on August 15, the U.S. Defence Department notified Congress last Friday of plans to sell Stinger missiles, launchers and other weapons to Taiwan.\nU.S. officials said the weapons were defensive and the sale would not affect the basic military balance in the region.\nThe Pentagon said Taiwan wanted to buy 1,299 Stinger missiles, 74 guided missile launchers, 74 flight trainer Stinger missiles, 96 jeep-like Humvee vehicles and 500 rounds of .50 calibre ammunition for an estimated $420 million.\nThe principal contractors are the Hughes Missile Systems Co., Boeing Missile and Space Systems Co. and AM General.\nSuch sales must be made through the U.S. Defence Department, not directly by contractors, and Congress must be notified in case it wants to veto the sale.\nSino-U.S. ties have see-sawed in recent years over disputes ranging from human rights abuses and widespread copyright piracy in China to alleged nuclear proliferation by Beijing.\nThe ties plunged to new depths over the last year in a row over a landmark trip by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui to the United States in June 1995.\nEarlier this month, Beijing warned Washington that a U.S. stopover by Taiwan's Vice-President Lien Chan could cause new damage to slowly recovering ties.\nHowever, in a sign that China was eager to prevent Lien's visit from harming slowly warming relations, Beijing refrained from further comment while Lien was in the United States.\nTies between Beijing and Washington were set on better footing after a visit to Beijing by U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake in July.\nThe trip laid the groundwork for an exchange of high-level visits later in the year, with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher invited to China in November and Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian due to go to Washington before the end of December.\nAn exchange of visits by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton could go ahead next year, if Clinton wins re-election in November.\nChinese officials have said they expect Christopher's visit, his first since a 1994 trip that stumbled badly over human rights, to go smoothly with both sides keen to remove obstacles in their relations.\nIn a separate development that could strain Sino-U.S. ties, the Washington Post reported on Sunday that U.S. intelligence officials had concluded that Pakistan was secretly building a medium-range missile factory near Islamabad using Chinese blueprints and equipment.\nAsked to comment on the report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said: \"The report is totally groundless.\"\n","15":"Chinese authorities have sealed off a town in northwestern Xinjiang and paramilitary police were patrolling the streets after at least 10 people were killed in a separatist Moslem riot last week, residents said on Tuesday.\n\"No one can leave, no one can enter,\" one resident said by telephone from Yining in the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture near the border with Kazakhstan.\nAuthorities closed the airport and railway station on Thursday and clamped an after-dark curfew on the mainly Moslem town, local residents said.\n\"They (outsiders) can't come to our town. We Yining residents can't go to neighbouring counties,\" another resident said. \"It is to guarantee public safety.\"\nAt least 10 people were killed, including one police officer, and some 100 wounded when 1,000 Moslem separatists of the Uighur ethnic minority rampaged through Yining on Wednesday to protest against Beijing rule, Chinese sources and residents have said.\nThe riot was among the most violent for many years in the restive region of Xinjiang, where Turkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority and ethnic Han Chinese make up 38 percent of the population.\nShops and restaurants were closed in the town and paramilitary police patrolled the streets.

Taiwanese economic officials are part of the delegation in a private capacity.\nTaiwan has banned direct trade, transport and mail links with China since 1949 when the nation's Nationalist rulers fled to the island after their defeat by the communists.\nIndirect trade and investment has been allowed since the late 1980s, usually through Hong Kong.\nJiang said China has always sought to speed up the establishment of direct trade and transport links with Taiwan.\nBeijing has stepped up pressure on the island to lift the ban. Last week it unilaterally announced a set of regulations to pave the way for direct links.\nMany Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport, but Taiwan has been reluctant to remove the curbs, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.\nKao Ching-yuan, head of the delegation, urged Beijing on Wednesday to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island's investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded ties.\nThe talks were suspended last year after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark trip to the United States. Beijing views the island as a rebel province and insists it is not entitled to official links with other states.\nKao, vice-chairman of President Enterprises, a major Taiwanese conglomerate, was quoted by state television as saying the Chinese market had great potential and many Taiwanese businessmen were pushing for expanded economic cooperation.\nPresident Enterprises is Taiwan's biggest investor in China.\nKao's visit came less than two weeks after Taiwan's President Lee called for a review of economic policy toward China with the aim of avoiding overdependence on the mainland.\nThe Taiwanese delegation was the largest to visit China since a trend of easing tensions was reversed by Lee's mid-1995 U.S. visit.\n","17":"A Chinese court on Thursday rejected a plea of insanity by a bank robber and sentenced him to death, along with two accomplices, for a string of heists that shocked Beijing.\nIn a rare move, officials allowed foreign reporters to watch the court proceedings against Guo Song and seven accessories, apparently to trumpet the success of a crackdown on crime launched this year.\nThe stocky Guo appeared unrepentant, his face set and defiant, as he was led from the courtroom by two policemen after the Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court convicted him of robbing three bank cash delivery vans this year.\n\"The court does not believe or accept defendant Guo Song's plea of insanity,\" the presiding judge said in his verdict.\n\"After psychiatric tests, Guo Song was found to have total control over his mental faculties and was responsible for his actions during the crime,\" said the judge, whose name was not available.\nThe 32-year-old defendant, dressed in a beige jacket and dark blue trousers, did not speak during the 20-minute hearing. He has two weeks in which to file an appeal to the Higher People's Court.\nThe presiding judge stood to read the verdict against the eight defendants lined up in front of him and each flanked by two police officers who held their arms at their sides.\nGuo, who had previously served a four-year term for rape, was found guilty of three bank robberies in Beijing in February, June and August this year, and of shooting dead four bank guards.\nThe robberies shocked the Chinese capital, where bank heists had been unheard of since the 1949 communist takeover.\nThe court sentenced two co-defendants to death for selling firearms to Guo.\nA fourth defendant was given a death sentence suspended for two years and a fifth was sentenced to life imprisonment for selling firearms.\nThree others, including Zhang Ying, 25, were sentenced to prison terms of up to seven years for harbouring a criminal. Zhang was the lone woman among the defendants.\nPolice tracked down Guo last September after police detained an accomplice of Guo's in the robberies, Lu Xianzhou, while he was driving a stolen car, state media reported.\nLu confessed to robbing the cash delivery vans and customers of banks and led police to Guo. It was not known if Lu has been sentenced.\nPolice had recovered six guns, 350 rounds of ammunition and part of the stolen cash -- 170,000 yuan ($20,000), 610,000 Japanese yen ($5,000) and $18,000.\nHundreds of thousands of people have been arrested and several thousand executed since China launched its Strike Hard crackdown against crime last April.\nCrime, virtually eliminated after the communists swept to power in 1949, has staged a comeback in the past two decades, springing up along with economic reforms that have loosened central controls while opening up opportunities for abuse of power.\nIllegal possession of firearms and gunrunning are widespread in China. The crime rate has soared, and 395 policemen were killed in the line of duty in 1995.\n","18":"China has jailed two Mongolians for up to 15 years on charges of separatism and espionage, the London-based human rights group Amnesty International said on Thursday.\nHada, 41, former manager of the Mongolian Academic Bookshop, and Tegexi, 30, who worked in the Inner Mongolian Bureau of Foreign Affairs, were sentenced last December to 15 and 10 years in prison respectively, Amnesty said.\nChinese courts rejected their appeals last month and upheld their original sentences, it said. The pair had been held for a year in solitary confinement without charges or a trial.\n\"No evidence has been made public to show that Hada and Tegexi were involved in any activity which may be regarded as criminal under international standards,\" Amnesty said.\nIt called for their immediate and unconditional release.\nThe Amnesty report could not be independently confirmed. Officials in China could not be reached for comment on the eve of Lunar New Year holidays.\nAmnesty said eight others were detained in December for alleged involvement in \"nationalist separatist\" activities, but were subsequently released.\nInner Mongolia, a Chinese province, is populated mainly by ethnic Mongolians but there has been little sign of anti-Chinese unrest since the early years after the 1949 communist takeover and the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when dissent was crushed.\nHowever, in late 1995, authorities in Inner Mongolia arrested 12 people who had demanded more democracy and an autonomous region, according to human rights groups.\nHada and Tegexi were being detained in poor conditions and their health was suffering, Amnesty said. They were living in a cell in Inner Mongolia's Number One Prison with over 30 other people, the report added.\nHada has a recurrence of tuberculosis and his neck was swollen, the group said. It was not known if he had received any medical treatment in prison.\nBeijing-based Western analysts say China has tightened its grip on dissent and separatist sentiment ahead of the British colony of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule on July 1.\n\"The harsh sentences passed on Hada and Tegexi are indicative of the severe attitude taken during the past year by the Chinese authorities towards suspected nationalists in...Tibet and Xinjiang,\" Amnesty said.\nInner Mongolia has traditionally been less restive than Tibet and Xinjiang.\nTibet has been rocked in recent years by periodic unrest, which China blames on the Himalayan region's god-king, the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India after an abortive uprising against communist rule in 1959.\nXinjiang borders Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states. The region has been shaken in recent months by several clashes and political killings involving separatists who want to end communist rule in Xinjiang.\n\"This 'crackdown' has also affected those whose peaceful religious activities are deemed to threaten 'national unity' and 'social stability',\" Amnesty said.\n","19":"China's propaganda machine had a field day on Thursday, lashing out at U.S. newspapers over accusations of torture and rape of Tibetan nuns and suggestions that the United States should get tough with China.\nThe overseas edition of the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, scoffed at accusations that Chinese authorities tortured, raped and murdered Tibetan nuns, monks and civilians in the restive Himalayan region.\n\"This series of articles in the Philadelphia Inquirer is weak to the extent that it is laughable,\" the newspaper said.\nThe Inquirer published last December a series of articles documenting what it said were stories of rape, torture and murder of Tibetan monks, nuns and ordinary people at the hands of Chinese authorities.\nIn the articles nearly two dozen cases were documented, including names and dates, from the Himalayan region that has been rocked in recent years by periodic anti-Chinese unrest led by monks and nuns seeking independence and the return of the exiled Dalai Lama.\n\"This is a critical story that lays bare the efforts by the (Chinese) government to wipe out the culture and religion of the Tibetan people through torture and worse,\" PRNewswire last December quoted Inquirer Editor Mawell E.P. King as saying.\nInternational human rights groups have made similar accusations, quoting Tibetans who fled China.\nChina denied the accusations.\n\"One of the main reasons for the Philadelphia Inquirer and some U.S. media to repeatedly fabricate lies about Tibet is their strong bias, arrogance and conceitedness,\" the People's Daily said.\n\"Using the so-called Tibet problem to incite anti-Chinese sentiment is fashionable among the U.S. media,\" it said.\nChina's propaganda machine also took on the New York Times, despite a recent rapid warming in ties between Beijing and Washington that had deteriorated in 1995 and up to mid-1996.\n\"The venom of the New York Times editorial lies in the fact that it...seditiously creates an atmosphere that will poison the relationship between China and the United States at a time when there is a tendency toward improving the bilateral relations,\" the Xinhua news agency said.\n\"The Times' editorial writer has one special skill: the ability to confuse black and white and to call a deer a house,\" Xinhua said.\nThe New York Times suggested in a January 30 editorial that U.S. President Bill Clinton should get tough with China.\n\"The demise of Communism may come someday in China, but it would be a mistake to adopt a passive American policy based on that optimistic prospect, as Mr. Clinton seems to be doing,\" the Times said.\n\"There is already abundant evidence suggesting that Communism in China is not dying but is instead mutating into a new form that tolerates economic liberties while still suffocating political freedom,\" the Times said.\nXinhua said comparing in the same breath the collapse of the Berlin Wall with socialist China, which is prospering, was an \"incongruous comparison\" just as \"donkeys' lips don't match horses' jaws\".\n","20":"The mayor of China's capital resigned on Tuesday in a reshuffle that had been expected since the downfall last year of his mentor, disgraced Beijing Communist Party boss Chen Xitong, in a corruption scandal.\nThe Beijing People's Congress had approved the resignation of city mayor Li Qiyan, the official Xinhua news agency said.\nIt did not explain why Li, 58, was stepping down, saying only that he would become secretary of the Labour Ministry's Communist Party committee.\nChinese sources have said Li Qiyan could eventually replace Li Boyong as labour minister. The two men have the same surname but are not related.\nDiplomats and Chinese sources said Li was forced to step down because of his close links to Chen, who resigned as Beijing party boss in April 1995 after his protege, a vice-mayor, came under investigation for economic crimes and committed suicide.\n\"Li Qiyan had been closely associated with Chen Xitong...and Li Qiyan's departure was inevitable,\" a Western diplomat said.\n\"When revelations about the extent of corruption in the Beijing government became public, sweeping changes of the Beijing leadership were required but could not be done in one go in the interest of preserving stability,\" the diplomat said.\nChinese sources said the city government had been virtually paralysed since Chen's downfall and that authorities had decided they could no longer delay naming a new mayor.\nChen was sacked from the party's powerful Politburo in September 1995, the most senior official to be ensnared in a corruption scandal since the communists came to power in 1949.\nHe has since disappeared from public view and has come under investigation for possible wrongdoing.\nIt was not known if Li was under investigation.\nXinhua said the Beijing People's Congress, or city council, had approved the appointment of Jia Qinglin, 56, as vice and acting mayor of the nation's capital.\nThe Central Committee of the Communist Party named Jia to the post of vice secretary of Beijing's party committee.\nJia had resigned as party secretary of the southeastern province of Fujian and was replaced by Fujian Governor Chen Mingyi, Xinhua said.\nFujian Vice-Governor He Guoqiang would replace Chen as the provincial governor, it said.\nIn the run-up to the party's 15th congress next year, Jia could be promoted to chief of the Beijing municipal party committee and even land a seat in the Politburo, Chinese sources have said.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.\nWang Baosen, the vice-mayor who committed suicide was found to have used his position to amass 116 houses illegally and build himself a villa on the outskirts of the city. He also masterminded a $37 million embezzlement and graft scam, officials have said.\nCommunist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus that threatened the party. Courts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases.\n","21":"Bankruptcies in China -- unheard of for almost four decades -- are expected to more than double in number this year as authorities try to shed hopelessly indebted firms.\nThe figure is expected to rise even further next year as officials become more determined not to subsidise loss-making state firms.\nMore than 5,200 Chinese companies were expected to go under in 1996, up from 2,200 in 1995 or more than the previous six years put together, Cao Siyuan, architect of China's bankruptcy law, said.\n\"Whether enterprises are psychologically prepared for it or not, the rate of bankruptcies gradually increasing is unavoidable,\" Cao said in a recent interview.\nIn the first half of this year, 1,692 enterprises declared bankruptcy, soaring by more than 107 percent compared with the year-ago period, said Cao, who now runs a consultancy to help enterprises seeking to merge or go bankrupt.\nA total of 1,625 firms declared bankruptcy in 1994, up from 710 in 1993, 428 in 1992, 117 in 1991 and 32 in 1990.\nChina passed a breakthrough bankruptcy law in 1988 in the first flush of an ambitious campaign to force lumbering state-owned enterprises to sink or swim in the marketplace.\nHowever, official fears of mass unemployment and social unrest if loss-making firms are allowed to go under has hampered implementation of the bitter medicine.\nBut China was expected to accelerate bankruptcies and mergers of state firms next year to reduce the burden on state coffers and slash subsidies to state enterprises.\nThere is little need for alarm for the ever-increasing number of bankruptcies because it is only a fraction of the total number of enterprises, said Cao.\n\"One can't say it's too big,\" Cao said of the number of insolvent enterprises. \"Currently, the bankruptcy rate is less than 0.1 percent (of the total number of firms)... One percent is normal.\"\nAbout one percent of China's estimated 100,000 state enterprises were hopelessly in debt and completely unattractive to investors looking for cheap companies to purchase or to merge with, Cao said.\nIn Huangshi city in the northern province of Hubei, about 80 percent of medium- and large-size state enterprises are losing money, the official People's Daily said.\nChina's state sector reported a historic net loss of 3.0 billion yuan ($361.4 million) in the first quarter, the first such deficit since the country embraced paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms in 1979.\nThe government allocated 20 billion yuan this year to write off bad debts of state firms which go under, but this is hardly enough, the People's Daily said.\nIn Wuhu city in the central province of Anhui, 420 million yuan is needed to write off the bad debts of 35 state firms, but only 50 million yuan has been allocated, the newspaper said.\n\"Mergers and bankruptcies... are roads without detour,\" the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, said.\n\"(Enterprises) which should die should be allowed to die,\" the newspaper said. \"Mergers and bankruptcies are a reform in which we have more to gain than lose.\"\nBut bankruptcies and mergers must guard against social unrest, debt evasion and theft of state assets, it said.\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)\n","22":"The seven-year-old boy chosen by China as Tibet's second holiest monk attended a ritual in Beijing last week to celebrate the first anniversary of his enthronement, major Chinese newspapers said on Wednesday.\nMonks pounded drums, rang bells and chanted Buddhist scriptures as Beijing's choice as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama visited the Yonghe Lamasery -- the Temple of Harmony and Peace, on November 22, the newspapers said, quoting a report by the official Xinhua news agency.\nXinhua gave no reason for the delay in reporting the celebrations which were held a week before the actual anniversary on November 29.\nTibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, has named another boy as the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama, the Himalayan region's second holiest monk who died in 1989.\nMany Tibetans see the Chinese-sanctioned child, Gyantsen Norpo, as a pretender.\nState media has given Beijing's choice much publicity in an apparent bid to convince Tibetans that he is the real reincarnation.\nMajor Chinese newspapers on Wednesday ran a picture of the child wearing traditional robes and a cap and surrounded by monks as he toured the Yonghe Lamasery which was built in 1694.\nThe boy blessed believers and preached from the seat reserved for the 10th Panchen Lama before his death.\nChinese sources have said Beijing's choice currently lives in the Chinese capital under state protection against any possible assassination attempts by radical Tibetans.\nWestern human rights groups have accused Beijing of detaining the boy recognised by the Dalai Lama and persecuting monks and nuns who refused to accept Beijing's choice.\nThe London-based human rights watchdog Tibet Information Network said last week a 19-year-old Tibetan nun had her jail term doubled to 18 years for refusing to recognise Beijing's choice.\nChina denies the accusations, saying the Dalai Lama's choice is \"leading a free life, just like other Tibetan children\".\nBut Beijing has refused to reveal the whereabouts of the Dalai Lama's choice or allow diplomats or foreign reporters to meet the boy.\nChina has lashed out at the exiled Tibetan leader, quoting the boy it anointed as the Panchen Lama as saying the Dalai Lama was the cause of turmoil in the region.\nThe Dalai Lama fled his homeland along with thousands of followers in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule. He heads a government-in-exile, which is not recognised by any country, in the Indian town of Dharamsala.\nThe Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, but Beijing views international support for Tibet's holiest man as a Western plot to split China and contain its development.\n","23":"China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, reported to be in fragile health, was absent from a rally on Tuesday to pay tribute to him and other survivors of the 1934-36 Long March.\nDeng, 92, one of about 700 surviving veterans of the Red Army who trekked 9,650 km (6,000 miles) across China on foot to flee Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops, did not appear on state television which showed the 45-minute rally live.\nDeng, who no longer holds any office but is believed to remain highly influential, has not been seen in public since early 1994.\nHis health is a matter of intense speculation in China, Hong Kong and the Asian region because his death is expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as de facto emperor of the world's most populous nation.\nThe official line is that Deng is in good health for a man of his age.\nExtensive preparations were made last year for Deng to grace official celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the World War Two victory against Japan, but his scheduled appearance was cancelled at the last minute, Chinese sources said.\nThe Long March rally was seen by some analysts as a show of support for Deng's successor, Communist Party boss and state president Jiang Zemin, who has been eager to shrug off the patriarch's shadow.\n\"It was staged to show Jiang has the support of military from the old to the present and future generations,\" one Chinese analyst said.\nLong March survivors, including former state president and Jiang's bitter rival Yang Shangkun, were at the rally. A representative of the three million-strong People's Liberation Army pledged to follow Jiang's leadership.\nEight Young Pioneers -- China's version of boy and girl scouts -- recited poems at the rally at the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing adjacent to Tiananmen Square.\nWearing his trademark army uniform with no stars or stripes, Jiang urged the ruling Communist Party to inherit the spirit of the Long March.\n\"The spirit of the Long March...is a strong spiritual force that guarantees our walking from victory to victory,\" Jiang said, reading from a prepared statement.\nThe gruelling Long March slashed the Red Army's numbers to about 7,000 from 100,000, but survivors were hardened and went on to defeat and drive Chiang and his troops into exile in Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.\n\"The road after the revolution is even longer and the work greater and tougher,\" Jiang said.\nJiang has declared war on crime, corruption and poverty -- problems plaguing China today -- and embarked on a crusade to resurrect socialist ethics, which have been eroded by almost two decades of economic reforms.\nHe paid little tribute to his mentor, mentioning Deng only twice in his lengthy speech.\nThe People's Daily, mouthpiece of the Communist Party, splashed on its front page a photograph showing portraits of Jiang, Deng and chairman Mao Zedong hanging over a cultural performance on Monday evening to mark the anniversary.\n","24":"Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has filed a lawsuit against Beijing authorities for sending him to a labour camp without trial, his wife said on Tuesday.\nLiu urged Beijing's Xuanwu District Court to overturn a decision by the Beijing Re-education through Labour Committee to send him to a labour camp for three years.\n\"I refuse to accept the decision,\" Liu said in his suit, a copy of which was made available to Reuters.\n\"I am appealing...not out of fear of losing freedom...but to defend my right to freedom of speech as a law-abiding citizen,\" the 41-year-old dissident said.\nPolice detained Liu, a renowned literary critic and prominent dissident, in September and sent him to a camp in the northeastern city of Dalian to serve three years of re-education through labour.\nRe-education through labour is a form of administrative punishment that can be imposed by authorities while avoiding the court system.\nWestern human rights activists say re-education through labour is increasingly favoured as a way of removing dissidents from circulation without the complications or publicity of a trial.\nThe dissident's wife, Liu Xia, told Reuters that the court had agreed to hear the suit though no date had been set.\nCourt officials declined to comment.\nAuthorities at the labour camp had rejected requests by Liu's family to visit him, his wife said.\n\"They (authorities) told his father that his performance was not good,\" Liu's wife said in an interview.\nShe said she held little hope of winning the suit.\nThe Re-education through Labour Committee accused Liu Xiaobo of \"concocting stories, distorting facts, libelling and sullying the government, stirring up trouble and disturbing social order\".\nIt said the alleged offences were committed in a petition to the government and a newspaper article written by Liu for a Taiwan newspaper.\nIn the government petition made last year, Liu and dozens of other intellectuals urged the government to reassess the June 1989 military crackdown on student-led demonstrations for democracy.\n\"Liu...was warned several times but was unrepentant and continued to engage in lawbreaking and criminal activities,\" said a document issued by the committee.\nIn the months before his incarceration, Liu orchestrated several daring, open letters to the government.\nOn September 30, Liu and another dissident, Wang Xizhe, issued a statement calling for the indictment and impeachment of Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin.\nThe pair demanded Jiang's resignation for violating the constitution for saying the People's Liberation Army was under the \"absolute leadership\" of the party instead of the state.\nWang fled to the United States in October.\nLast week, Beijing's Chaoyang District Court rejected the lawsuit of another dissident, Liu Nianchun, against a similar labour camp term.\nChina dismisses international criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.\nChinese authorities have dealt crushing blows to the tiny democracy movement in recent months. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are in prison or labour camp.\n","25":"China on Tuesday slammed Taiwan for failing to crack down on a new opposition party seeking independence for the island and warned that separatism was \"a road to death\".\n\"Not only do the Taiwan authorities fail to ban the formation of the Taiwan Independence Party, but they also tolerate it,\" a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council, or cabinet, said.\n\"The self-proclaimed anti-independence stand of the Taiwan authorities is a double-faced practice that deceives others as well as themselves,\" the official People's Daily quoted the spokesman as saying.\nBeijing has regarded Taiwan as a rebel province since Mao Zedong's Red Army defeated and drove Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops into exile in Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.\nA group of Taiwanese activists plan to break away from Taiwan's main opposition party and form the Taiwan Independence Party on December 12.\nChina has threatened to invade if Taiwan declared independence. China conducted missile tests and war games off Taiwan last March in the run-up to the island's first direct presidential elections to cow Taipei into abandoning any dreams of independence.\n\"Taiwan independence is a road to death that cannot be walked because it is blocked,\" the spokesman said.\nThe spokesman described the party as a \"reactional political organisation\" with the explicit purpose of splitting the motherland.\n\"The Taiwan authorities should adopt realistic anti-independence action as soon as possible. Compatriots on the two sides are waiting to see,\" the spokesman said.\n\"The Chinese government and the Chinese people will definitely not sit back idly and do nothing about it,\" the spokesman warned.\n\"Their scheme will never succeed,\" he said of the new party's drive for independence.\nTaiwan says it is committed to reunification, but stresses that this cannot be achieved overnight and says China must democratise.\nBeijing's criticism came a day after Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui blamed China for deadlocked relations between the two.\nReferring to the Communist authorities, Lee said in a speech on Monday: \"They adopted a hegemonic attitude and stubborn policy toward Taiwan, singlehandedly blocked the development of history and caused the stalemate of cross-Strait relations.\"\nThe island maintains an official policy of anti-independence, but has decriminalised advocacy of independence, saying such calls are within the bounds of freedom of speech.\nTies between Beijing and Taipei, which began to thaw in the late 1980s, took an icy plunge after a landmark, private visit by Lee to the United States in June 1995.\nChina, which has sought to push Taiwan into diplomatic isolation, saw the trip as a bid to raise the island's international profile.\nBeijing has stepped up its reunification overture in recent months, calling for political talks to end almost five decades of hostility.\nChina unilaterally introduced a series of regulations last August to pave the way for direct shipping links with Taiwan.\nTaiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since 1949, but allows indirect links through Hong Kong or third countries. Taiwan is reluctant to lift the ban lest the island become an economic hostage to China.\n","26":"China began the trial of prominent dissident and former student leader Wang Dan on Wednesday on the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government, a court official said.\n\"The trial started at 9.00 a.m. (0100 GMT),\" said an official of the Beijing People's Intermediate Court reached by telephone. He declined to give further details.\nSecurity was tight around the court building in western Beijing, with dozens of police preventing the public from approaching the building and manning roadblocks to prevent access.\nThe father of the former student leader protested his son's innocence just hours before the start of the proceedings and said the family would not give in to the authorities.\n\"He is definitely innocent,\" Wang Xianzeng told reporters as he left his home with the dissident's mother, Wang Lingyun, to go to the court. \"It just depends on whether the government wants to convict him or not.\"\nWang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in.\n\"I'm not optimistic about the results,\" Wang Xianzeng said. \"We will definitely appeal... We will not give in.\n\"Speech can't overthrow the government,\" he said.\nThe court indictment against Wang, 27, includes the charge that his writings in foreign publications were evidence of his plot to try to overthrow the government.\nHe is also accused of accepting foreign funds, of colluding with subversives living overseas and of conspiring with domestic plotters to organise the overthrow of the government.\nWang Lingyun said on Tuesday she expected Wang to receive a harsh sentence although he would plead not guilty.\nThe former student leader faces a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.\nThe mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health had deteriorated since he vanished into detention in May 1995.\nShe said court officials told her the verdict could be delivered as early as Wednesday or in two days. Family members had been under surveillance for several weeks, she added.\nThe New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.\nHuman Rights Watch attacked the trial on Tuesday as a sign of the Chinese leadership's increasing intolerance of dissent.\n\"The fact is that China's urban dissident movement...has in effect been comprehensively smashed,\" it said in a statement.\nWang's court appearance was expected to resemble the in-camera proceedings last December against Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.\nWang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nHe was politically active again after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.\nChina has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.\n","27":"A Chinese court has sentenced dissident and former student leader Li Hai to nine years in prison for prying into state secrets in a trial held behind closed doors, a family member said on Tuesday.\n\"We're very surprised,\" the relative, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters by telephone.\nLi had initially been charged with leaking state secrets, but his family and lawyer challenged the charges, arguing that the dissident was not a civil servant and had no access to state secrets.\nThe court \"lacked evidence to convict (Li) of leaking state secrets. We thought he would get a lighter sentence ... (after) the charge was changed to prying into state secrets,\" Li's relative said.\nInstead, Beijing's Chaoyang District Court sentenced Li to nine years in prison for prying into state secrets, the relative said.\n\"We're not convinced at all,\" he said.\nThe relative said he believed the appeal process had already started. The appeals trial was also expected to be held behind closed doors because the case involved state secrets.\n\"Our only hope is in the appeal,\" he said.\nIt was not clear how Li had pried into state secrets or if any other people have been arrested or charged.\nThe family has not been allowed to meet Li since he was detained in May 1995.\nLi was first arrested in May 1990 for his role in the 1989 student demonstrations for democracy. He was released six months later and expelled from the philosophy department of the prestigious Beijing University, where he was a graduate student.\nHe was one of 56 signatories to a pro-democracy peace charter issued in May 1995 to coincide with the sixth anniversary of the military crackdown on the student demonstrations.\nChina jailed dozens of dissidents in 1996 as part of a drive for stability that followed an easing of foreign pressure over its human rights record, diplomats and activists said. Authorities jailed or sent to labour camps 12 better-known dissidents in 1996. Of the 12, former student leader Wang Dan received the harshest sentence -- 11 years -- for conspiring to subvert the government.\nWestern human rights activists said sending dissidents to labour camps has been increasingly favoured as a way of removing them from society without the complications or publicity of a trial.\nAt least 10 lesser-known political activists have been incarcerated in the northern region of Inner Mongolia. In the southwestern city of Guiyang, another seven to eight dissidents have been jailed.\nAt least two dissidents fled to the United States this year -- former student leader Liu Gang and veteran dissident Wang Xizhe.\n","28":"China has jailed dozens of dissidents this year amid Beijing's obsession with stability coupled with easing foreign pressure on its human rights record, human rights groups and diplomats said on Wednesday.\nAuthorities have jailed 12 better-known dissidents or sent them to labour camps in the past year, the Hong Kong-based Information Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.\nAt least 10 lesser-known political activists have been incarcerated in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, Liu Qing, chairman of the New York-based Human Rights in China, said in a telephone interview.\nIn the southwestern city of Guiyang, another seven to eight dissidents have been jailed, Liu said. He declined to elaborate on the cases pending verification of details.\n\"A lot more dissidents were jailed this year than in previous years,\" Liu said. \"There are not many prominent dissidents left.\"\nLiu, who served 10 years in prison for his role in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement and left for the United States in 1992, attributed the tougher policy on dissent to an easing of foreign pressure on China.\n\"International pressure on China's human rights is easing and disappearing,\" he said.\n\"This undoubtedly is tantamount to telling the Chinese Communists that the Chinese government can go all out and persecute dissidents,\" Liu said.\nThe United States delinked human rights from its annual review of renewing Most Favoured Nation trading status for China in 1994. Many business-minded Western governments have been accused of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses in China.\nOf the 12 better-known dissidents to be locked up this year, former student leader Wang Dan received the harshest sentence -- 11 years -- for conspiring to subvert the government.\nA Beijing court took just 10 minutes last month to reject an appeal by Wang, a leader of student-led demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nAnother nine dissidents, including Liu Qing's younger brother Liu Nianchun, were ordered to serve up to three years of re-education through labour.\nLabour re-education is an administrative punishment that can be imposed by authorities without recourse to the judiciary.\nWestern human rights activists say re-education through labour is increasingly favoured as a way of removing dissidents from circulation without the complications or publicity of a trial.\nAnother dissident serving time at a labour camp, Chen Longde, jumped from a third-floor window in a suicide attempt in August because he could not tolerate alleged beating by prison guards, family members said. Prison officials deny the charge.\nTwo dissidents fled to the United States this year -- former student leader Liu Gang and veteran dissident Wang Xizhe.\nObsession with stability was another factor in China intensifying its crackdown on dissent, diplomats said.\n\"The government is obsessed with matters of stability at the moment and all the more so because the 15th party congress is around the corner,\" a Western diplomat said, referring to the crucial five-yearly meeting due late next year.\n\"In the eyes of the leadership, dissidents represent a potential threat to stability and social order,\" he said. \"The leadership fears that treating them leniently would only encourage others to challenge the authority of the party.\"\nChina dismisses international criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.\n","29":"Will the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping plunge the world's most populous country into chaos and division, or will heir apparent Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin take over the reins?\nDiplomats and analysts said on Thursday they expected calm before any storm.\nWill Deng's anointed successor, who also holds the jobs of state President and head of the armed forces, escape the fate of Chairman Mao Zedong's chosen heir -- a man who survived less than two years when he locked horns with Deng over power?\nWill Jiang reverse his mentor's economic reforms and return to Mao Zedong's orthodox communism? Will a power struggle brew behind the scenes among those eager to succeed Deng as China's de facto emperor?\nThe world will be watching to see which way China's political winds blow -- and how the leadership copes with a plethora of problems from unemployment, a widening gap between rich and poor, corruption and a one-party system.\n\"I don't think there will be an immediate power struggle,\" one Western diplomat said on Thursday. \"The immediate concern will be to present a face of calm, stability and normality.\"\nDeng died late on Wednesday of respiratory failure -- a complication from Parkinson's disease and a lung infection. He ws 93 by Chinese reckoning, which adds a year to one's age.\nHis pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse.\n\"There hasn't been such a death in 20 years, of such a prominent figure,\" another diplomat said.\nChina would be obsessed with stability and security, but the country could ground to a halt for some time while the nation mourns and leaders jockey for position, analysts said.\n\"There's going to be a lot more emphasis on stability, more focus on internal security so it's going to be... a cautious leadership,\" Hong Kong-based Sinologist Tai Ming Cheung said.\n\"There may be a certain amount of policy paralysis, which has been there already, but beyond that I don't see any great changes,\" Cheung said. \"There is going to be a lull.\"\nOne Chinese analyst, who asked not to be identified, said stability would be a facade.\n\"It'll be like a duck swimming -- on the surface it'll be calm but underneath it'll be turbulent,\" said the analyst, quoting a Chinese proverb.\nJiang, 70, appears to have consolidated his power base.\nBut his political rivals, including Qiao Shi, 72, chairman of the National People's Congress, or parliament, were expected to jostle for power in the run-up to a crucial party congress later this year, analysts said.\n\"I expect an increase in political jockeying,\" Cheung said.\n\"I think that Jiang is making all the running and he is in a fairly strong position, so he is the one -- barring any mistakes -- to take full advantage, but then the other people will be pushing just as hard,\" Cheung said.\nJiang's predecessor, Zhao Ziyang, 77, who was sacked in 1989 as general secretary of the party for showing sympathy to students demonstrating for democracy, is waiting in the wings to stage a political comeback.\nZhao has not been seen in public for more than six years and is believed to be living under house arrest in Beijing.\nMost analysts say Jiang is in control, but some write him off as a transitional leader.\n\"He (Jiang) has been consolidating his power considerably over the last year,\" the first diplomat said. \"He is now less dependent on Deng Xiaoping.\"\n","30":"Chinese activists, in a statement on Tuesday hours ahead of a visit by the U.S. Secretary of State, protested against American backing for Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.\n\"We hold that Japan is not qualified to become a permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations,\" the activists said in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is due to arrive in Beijing later on Tuesday for a three-day visit.\nThe letter, signed by 15 activists, said they opposed Japan becoming a permanent member of the Security Council because many Japanese politicians had been reluctant to apologise for its war atrocities and had tried to whitewash history.\nChina says more than 35 million people were killed or wounded during Japan's invasion and occupation of most of China from the early 1930s to 1945.\n\"(We) strongly protest the U.S. government supporting Japan's (bid) to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to draw Japan over to its side,\" said the letter, a copy of which was made available to Reuters.\nTong Zeng, a leader of the group, said he would forward the letter to Christopher through the U.S. embassy in Beijing.\nThe Chinese government, eager for more low-interest loans from Japan, has been reluctant to antagonise Tokyo and has not taken a public stance on the issue.\nThe United States has long supported giving Japan and Germany permanent seats on the Security Council.\nThe council currently consists of five permanent members that were the main victors in World War Two -- the United States, Russia, Britain, China and France -- and 10 non-permanent members who serve two-year terms.\nMost Chinese have been slow to forgive Japan's war past.\n\"U.S. backing for Japan's (bid)...will undoubtedly encourage the resurrection of Japanese militarism and bring a new threat to the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,\" the letter said.\nThe anti-Japanese activists recounted what they said were U.S. mistakes, including not putting Emperor Hirohito on trial after the end of World War Two in 1945.\n\"After the end of the war, the United States harmed the feelings of the Chinese people several times...sheltering Japan's top war criminal Emperor Hirohito,\" the letter said. Hirohito died in 1989.\nThe activists also faulted the United States for \"ignoring historical facts\" and handing disputed islands in the East China Sea to Japan in 1971.\nSino-Japanese ties were strained this year over the islands, which Beijing calls the Diaoyus and Tokyo the Senkakus.\nA Japanese right-wing group built a makeshift lighthouse on one of the islands in July, triggering anti-Japanese demonstrations in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\nTaiwan's Nationalist rulers, who lost the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949, also claim the islands. Activists in the British colony of Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, have opposed Japan's territorial claims.\nEmotions were fanned in September when a Hong Kong activist drowned after he jumped into stormy waters around the islands to demonstrate support for Chinese claims.\n","31":"China rejected on Tuesday an invitation for one of its top policymakers to visit Taiwan, saying the island must first abandon its bid to break out of diplomatic isolation.\n\"It is impossible,\" a spokesman for the cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office said when asked if the office's director Wang Zhaoguo would accept the invitation from Taiwanese business leader Kao Ching-yuan.\nThe spokesman said the time for such a visit was not ripe because Taiwan had yet decided to abandon its \"pragmatic foreign policy\" of trying to boost its international standing.\n\"Taiwan...should not seek to enter the United Nations,\" the spokesman told Reuters by telephone. Taipei lost its seat in the United Nations when Beijing took its place in 1971.\nChina regards Taiwan as a rebel province and insists the island is not entitled to official links with other states.\nIf Wang had accepted and Taiwanese authorities had allowed him to visit, he would have been the most senior Chinese official to set foot on the island since the end of China's civil war in 1949.\nLast week, a spokesman for a delegation of Taiwanese business leaders visiting Beijing quoted Wang as saying he would be happy to visit Taiwan if he had an opportunity, but that there was no definite commitment to accept.\nThe backpedalling by China on Tuesday indicated it was unwilling to make up with Taiwan for now, said a Chinese analyst familiar with Beijing government policy.\nTies between Beijing and Taipei were strained after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark visit to the United States last year in a bid to lift the island out of diplomatic isolation.\nChina held war games and missile tests off Taiwan in a show of force in the run-up to the island's first presidential elections in March, which Lee won by a landslide.\nTaiwan, an island with a population of 21 million, is eager to make up with its giant neighbour, the world's most populous nation with 1.2 billion people.\nLast week, Taiwanese business leader Kao urged China to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island's investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded ties.\nBut China was in no hurry to mend political fences, preferring instead to continue heaping pressure on Taiwan, said the analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\"China is trying to use Taiwan's industrial and commercial sector to put pressure on the Taiwan authorities,\" he said.\nLast month, China stepped up pressure on Taiwan to lift a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport links between the two sides by unilaterally announcing a set of regulations for such links.\nTaiwan has banned direct trade, transport and mail links since 1949. Indirect trade and investment has been allowed since the late 1980s, usually through Hong Kong.\nMany Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport, but Taiwan has been reluctant to remove the curbs, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.\nLast month, China called for political talks with Taiwan to end the state of hostility to pave the way for reunification.\nBoth China and Taiwan agree to eventually reunify but on very different terms.\n","32":"China's propaganda machine on Thursday hailed the selection of Hong Kong's first post-colonial chief executive as the beginning of \"true democracy\" in the territory.\n\"This is a day to be remembered in Hong Kong's democratic development,\" the China Daily said of the choice of shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa as chief executive-designate of post-colonial Hong Kong.\n\"It is...the beginning of Hong Kong's true democracy,\" the official newspaper said in a commentary.\nTung was elected on Wednesday by a 400-member Selection Committee -- its members hand-picked by Beijing -- making him the territory's leader-in-waiting.\nHe will formally take up the job when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, 1997, ending more than 150 years of British rule.\nMajor Chinese newspapers splashed across their front page news of Tung's election and a picture of the bespectacled tycoon smiling and waving with his wife by his side.\nThe newspapers carried a commentary by the official Xinhua news agency, which trumpeted Hong Kong-style democracy as \"totally new, that is different from the mainland as well as different from the West\".\n\"We can see that Hong Kong is establishing a democratic way that is based on law, open, fair, civilised and proceeding in an orderly way and step by step,\" Xinhua said.\nChina, angered at Western-style democratic reforms introduced by Hong Kong's outgoing Governor Chris Patten, has vowed to dismantle the territory's elected Legislative Council after the handover and install an appointed legislature.\nXinhua took a swipe at Britain, saying: \"In the past 100 years, there has been no democracy in Hong Kong's political life under Britain's rule.\"\n\"All powers, including executive, legislative, judicial and military rights, were granted to the Hong Kong governors, who were appointed by Britain without consulting the local people,\" Xinhua said.\n\"It is China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong...that offers Hong Kong the unprecedented opportunity for its democratic development,\" it said.\nXinhua urged China's rival, Taiwan, to return to the fold.\n\"Resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong...is the first step of the Chinese nation's great undertaking to realise reunification of the motherland under the leadership of the Communist Party,\" Xinhua said.\nIt said Wednesday's elections were vital to reunification with Taiwan under the \"one country, two systems\" formula, in which the island, like Hong Kong, would enjoy a great degree of autonomy and be allowed to maintain its capitalist system.\nBeijing and Taipei have been political rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Taiwan's Nationalist rulers say they are committed to reunification, but only under Western-style democracy.\nThe political waters ahead could be choppy for the shipping tycoon.\n\"People will be watching what happens to Anson Chan,\" a Western diplomat in Beijing said.\nTung has said he would like to keep Chan as chief secretary, but her past defence of Patten's democratic reforms could make things awkward if she decides to stay on.\n\"She'll have to preside over many policies that she has opposed,\" the diplomat said. \"People want to see how she manages this.\"\n","33":"The mother of detained Chinese dissident Wang Dan said on Monday she would defend her son against the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government and that he was prepared for a heavy sentence.\n\"Two defence counsels are allowed...I will be one of them,\" Wang Lingyun, a 61-year-old researcher at a museum who has no background in law, told Reuters in an interview.\n\"Wang Dan also wants me to defend him,\" she said. Chinese laws allow accused to be defended by family members.\nA court spokeswoman confirmed Wang Dan, 26, had been charged with plotting to overthrow the government but declined to give further details.\nWang Dan's mother said the court had yet to inform her of the trial date, but said it could come as early as this week.\nThe dissident, detained without charge since May 1995, met his mother for the first time under police surveillance at a detention centre in Beijing, the Hong Kong-based Information Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.\n\"Wang Dan...was very calm and psychologically prepared for a heavy sentence,\" the group quoted the mother as saying. She added that she was worried about her son's health.\nShe told Reuters earlier that she would defend her son against the charge of collaborating with overseas subversive forces. \"This charge does not stand up,\" she said, adding that Wang Dan had only taken a correspondence course at the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States.\n\"It has nothing to do with politics. I was the one who wanted him to attend the course...It has nothing to do with overthrowing the government,\" she said.\nAsked to comment on the chances of winning the case, she said: \"I'm not optimistic. But I must say it for the record. This will become history.\"\nRelatives said last week they had found a lawyer willing to defend Wang after being given one day to find one.\nThe lawyer retained by the family would defend the dissident against other charges in the indictment.\nWang Dan, former leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations, has been charged with the capital offence of plotting to subvert the government, based on evidence such as writings critical of the state and accepting funds from abroad.\nHe was detained by police in a raid on his home in May 1995, but was not formally arrested or charged until last week.\nOn Friday, the family obtained a copy of the bill of indictment, which accused Wang Dan of plotting to subvert the government, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death. The minimum sentence is 10 years, although the court can show leniency if it finds extenuating circumstances.\nWang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in the 1989 demonstrations centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, which were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life.\nWang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng of plotting to overthrow the government also implicated the former student leader.\nThe court's verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people \"convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan\". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.\nWang had been active since his release from jail, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.\n","34":"Selling motorcycles used to be a joy ride for the giant, military-founded China Jialing Industrial Co Ltd, but then it ran into real market competition and growth slowed down sharply.\n\"Up until 1995, we sold as much as we produced,\" said Tian Min, deputy director of financial affairs at the Shanghai-listed firm, in which the Chinese government has a 75 percent stake.\nBut Jialing, China's biggest motorcycle manufacturer and a former munitions manufacturer that began making civilian products in 1979, saw rival manufacturers mushroom across China in 1994 and 1995 to cash in on its market.\nCutthroat competition slashed prices and profits and swelled stockpiles last year.\n\"In 1996, we could not sell what we produced,\" Tian said in an interview at Jialing's headquarters in China's wartime capital of Chongqing in southwestern Sichuan province.\nJialing's sales plunged to 3.5 billion yuan ($421.7 million) in 1996 from 4.6 billion yuan in 1995. After-tax profits tumbled to 270 million yuan in 1996 from 460 million yuan in 1995.\n\"Sales in 1994 and 1995 were good and many seeing this jumped aboard,\" Tian said.\nChina has about 300 motorcycle plants with total annual production capacity of 20 million units, but only 10 make more than 100,000 a year.\nChina is the world's largest motorcycle maker, churning out 7.83 million units in 1995, but selling only 6.1 million.\nVice-Premier Zhu Rongji has called for moves to curb blind investment in industries that appear profitable.\nBlind investment is being repeated in many sectors, such as colour televisions, washing machines and refrigerators. Production has outstripped demand, leading to overheated competition, price wars and mounting losses among state firms.\nAdding to the problems of motorcycle manufacturers, some regional governments, alarmed at traffic congestion and air pollution, have discouraged motorcycle purchases by curbing the issue of licence plates.\nTIGHT MONETARY POLICY TO BLAME\nTian also blamed the company's woes on the government's tight monetary policy to rein in galloping inflation.\n\"The motorcycle market shrank...because people have less money...and less buying power,\" he said.\nTight monetary policy has also resulted in triangular debt, or debt owed among state-owned firms, and cash flow problems.\n\"Debts owed to each other are very serious...We can't get our money back for motorcycles sold,\" Tian said.\nJialing's collectibles soared to 700 million yuan in 1996.\nThe company has formed debt collection squads and aims to reduce collectibles to 300 million yuan by end-1997. Collectibles were virtually non-existent in 1994.\nSTRUGGLING TO REMAIN NUMBER ONE\nThe climb to the top is hard. Staying on top is even harder.\nA price war has forced Jialing to slash prices by an average of 13 percent in 1997, Tian said. The price cut was expected to reduce sales by 400 million yuan a year.\nSales staff would receive commissions linked to performance instead of a fixed salary to try to increase sales, he said.\nJialing will curb waste and cut stockpiles, now 80,000-90,000. It is inviting tenders to force competition among parts suppliers and expects to save 300 million yuan in 1997.\nIts motorcycle engines are produced at a joint venture plant with Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd.\nSales were forecast to hit 4.2 billion yuan in 1997, while profits would be \"no lower\" than in 1996, Tian said.\nJialing would produce 1.35 million motorcycles in 1997 from 1.13 million in 1996. It has capacity for 1.7 million.\nIts 1995 output of 1.1085 million motorcycles accounted for 14 percent of the national total of 7.83 million. Jialing's output was forecast to hit two million in the year 2000.\nAMBITIONS RISE BEYOND MOTORCYCLES\nJialing has ambitions to do more than produce motorcycles.\nIt has applied to issue H shares in Hong Kong to raise funds to expand into car production, financing and pharmaceuticals.\nThe company wants to set up a non-bank financial institution to finance motorcycle sales, Tian said.\nTo meet the challenges of China's fledgling market economy, Jialing, like many state enterprises, must tackle overstaffing and the burden of cradle-to-grave welfare for its employees.\nJialing plans to lay off about one percent of its 12,500 employees in 1997, with the accumulated figure hitting 3,000 in the year 2000, Tian said.\n\"We're not like capitalist countries...we can't just abandon them,\" Tian said. \"We have to help them to find new jobs...or it'll bring problems to our social order and stability.\"\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)\n","35":"A Chinese court on Friday took 10 minutes to reject the appeal of dissident Wang Dan and uphold an 11-year prison sentence for subversion, his mother said.\nThe verdict came four days before the scheduled arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who diplomats say was expected to raise human rights issues in his meetings with Chinese leaders during his visit.\nAngry family members staged a one-hour sit-down protest in front of the Beijing Higher People's Court after the court rejected Wang's appeal against his conviction, she said.\n\"It (the verdict) was all prepared in advance,\" Wang Lingyun told Reuters in a telephone interview.\n\"I'm very angry. It was very unfair,\" she said. \"The (appeals) court just copied the verdict of the first trial.\"\nThe 27-year-old dissident was not allowed to speak at his appeal hearing as a judge read from a brief, prepared statement, the mother said.\nWang was convicted of plotting to subvert the government by publishing articles in foreign publications and receiving funds from hostile overseas organisations.\nThe mother said she would petition the appeals court but that it would be a formality and would not involve the court holding another trial.\nCourt officials, reached by telephone, declined comment. The tightly-controlled state media made no mention of Wang's conviction.\nPolice earlier kept reporters away from the court building, the family's home and nearby subway stations.\nThe dissident, wearing a red sweater and grey suit, appeared in low spirits and poor health, the mother said.\n\"(But) he was psychologically prepared. It came as no surprise. He does not have any illusions about them (the authorities),\" she said.\nThe former student leader had already served four years in prison for his role in student demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the army in 1989.\nThe U.S. secretary of state, scheduled to arrive on Tuesday, was likely to bring up human rights when he meets Chinese leaders.\nSino-U.S. relations have been strained over the last year by issues ranging from human rights to Taiwan to arms proliferation and trade.\nBeijing has slammed Western criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.\nFormer British prime minister Margaret Thatcher said in Beijing on Thursday that the world was dismayed by harsh sentences slapped on Wang and fellow dissident Wei Jingsheng, the father of China's modern democracy movement.\nThe jailing of Wang was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China's struggling democracy movement. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps.\nChina has said Wang's trial last month by a lower court was open and fair but the New York-based Human Rights in China said no foreign reporters, diplomats or other international observers were allowed to attend.\nHuman Rights in China has denounced the trial as a \"secret trial\" on a trumped up charge. The lower court took less than four hours to convict and sentence Wang on October 30.\n","36":"Beijing has pledged to open its doors to imports of U.S. textiles under a new deal, but Washington has no illusions it can close its yawning textile trade gap with China, diplomats said Monday.\nChinese and U.S. negotiators signed a new textile agreement in Beijing on Sunday in an 11th-hour deal that ended the threat of a cross-Pacific trade war and ensured U.S. access to China's textile markets.\n\"It provides us with an opportunity to increase our access to China's markets in high-priority areas,\" one U.S. diplomat said. He declined to elaborate.\n\"(But) we are under no illusions that we are going to balance textiles as a single sector of our trade,\" said a second diplomat, who requested anonymity.\nChina exported $6.5 billion worth of textiles to the United States in 1995 but imported only $64 million worth. Diplomats attributed the sluggish U.S. textile exports to Beijing's high tariff rates and non-tariff barriers.\n\"Textiles are never going to be balanced but it's important that there be a market access element there,\" the second diplomat said.\nThe agreement gave China a U.S. import quota slightly larger than the previous 1994 textile pact, and China pledged to reduce its tariffs on textile imports.\nBoth the Chinese and U.S. sides declined to say by how much U.S. textile exports to China would increase and vice versa, or by how much China's tariffs would be cut.\n\"There are significant gains for U.S. industries,\" a third diplomat said.\n\"It was, for the first time, a concessionary admission on (the) part of the Chinese that they too had to do something with regard to supplying market access for U.S. products where we were competitive,\" he said.\nThe overall U.S. trade deficit with China -- the United States' largest after its deficit with Japan -- was seen reaching $38 billion in 1996, up from $34 billion in 1995, according to U.S. figures.\nThe new textile agreement may be good news for U.S. textile manufacturers and exporters, but it could be bad news for China's lumbering state enterprises.\nA flood of U.S. textile imports could intensify competition and further cripple many of China's state enterprises, almost half of which are in the red, analysts said.\n\"U.S. textile imports will intensify competition in the already saturated domestic textile market,\" a Chinese economist said. \"Life will be even more difficult for a group of money-losing textile enterprises,\" said the economist, who asked not to be identified. \"Some enterprises will be forced to bow out of the textile industry -- declare bankruptcy or merge.\"\nState-owned textile factories in Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, registered losses of 350 million yuan ($42.2 million) in the first seven months of 1996, the China Business Times said Monday.\nThe accord ended the threat of a Sino-U.S. trade war, which had loomed after Washington slapped $19 million in penalties on Chinese imports last September, accusing Beijing of shipping textiles through third countries to evade U.S. restrictions on Chinese imports.\nChina had threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks. But it delayed the action to allow time for further talks.\nBeijing announced after Sunday's deal that it was calling off its retaliatory measures, but Washington's penalties remained in force.\n","37":"China is considering restrictions on foreign investment in textiles, garments and sectors where domestic production capacity is already excessive, a senior official of the State Statistical Bureau said on Tuesday.\n\"The production capacity of some of our traditional industries, such as textiles and garments, is pitifully excessive,\" Li Qiming, director of the bureau's department of industry and transportation statistics, told Reuters.\n\"We are currently considering...whether to restrict foreign businessmen from entering sectors in which domestic production capacity is already abundant,\" Li said. He did not elaborate.\nThe losses of state enterprises in these industries exceed the national average, Li said but gave no specific figures.\nChina has said it would curb textile output and unnecessary expansion in the industry in 1997 to reduce losses in the state sector. It has set a target of phasing out obsolete textile equipment, including 10 million cotton spindles.\n\"There were 429 state textile enterprises that posted losses of more than five million yuan ($602,000) each in 1995. Their combined losses reached 5.21 billion yuan.\"\n\"Indigenous enterprises are being squeezed...in some traditional industries,\" Li told a news conference.\n\"We may have to consider protection,\" he said.\nThe bureau spent one year and mobilised five million pollsters to conduct a survey of industries that showed that foreign investment was concentrated mainly in electronics, telecommunications, textile, garment and food processing, officials said.\nChina's 10 eastern coastal provinces and provincial-level cities have attracted 87 percent of total foreign investment, while five provinces in northwest China took in less than one percent of foreign investment, Li said.\nThe survey showed 59,311 wholly foreign-owned and Sino-foreign joint ventures had set up in China by the end of 1995, up 29,343, or 97.9 percent compared with end-1994.\nTheir combined output value was 1.2 trillion yuan ($144.6 billion) at end-1995, the survey showed. They made profits totalling 79.2 billion and paid 39.8 billion yuan in taxes.\nThe number of foreign-funded enterprises accounted for 10 percent of the total number of enterprises in China, but the output of foreign firms accounted for 20 percent of the total.\nHong Kong and Taiwan businessmen were the biggest investors, accounting for 32.6 percent of the total. It was inevitable that the government would impose restrictions on foreign investment in industries to protect the state sector, analysts said.\nAbout 38 percent of state enterprises registered losses in 1996 compared with the previous year, Li said.\nLosses posted by state firms soared 37.53 percent in 1996, he said.\nPre-tax profits of state enterprises slipped 4.83 percent in 1996 while after-tax profits plunged 42.5 percent.\nExcessive stockpiles accounted for 20 percent of funds tied up by finished products.\nDebts owed among enterprises worsened, with collectibles of state enterprises increasing by 11.8 percent in 1996.\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)\n","38":"China has vowed to curb the influence of Buddhism in Tibet, saying religion would have to bow to socialism.\nMonks outnumbered students and more money was spent on monasteries than on Communist Party buildings in the Himalayan region, the official Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Wednesday.\n\"In the basic interest of the Tibetan people, further development of temples, monks and nuns cannot be without restrictions,\" the newspaper said.\n\"Satisfying the basic needs of believers will do.\"\nThere were 1,787 temples in the restive region by early 1996, with 46,000 monks and nuns -- exceeding the number of high school students in the region, the newspaper said. It gave no comparative figures.\nChina has shut many temples in Tibet in recent years to uproot the influence of the region's spiritual god-king, the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule.\nSocialism must take precedence over religion, the newspaper said.\n\"Religion must adapt to the development needs of socialism and not socialism adapting to the needs of religion. We must remain clear-headed on this principle,\" it said.\nThe Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, but Beijing views international support for Tibet's holiest man as a Western plot to return the region to feudal rule and split China.\nBeijing says the Dalai Lama is a political activist and not a purely religious figure.\n\"International anti-Chinese forces use the Tibet issue to contain China's development and (the Tibet issue) is an important means to 'Westernise' and 'divide' China,\" the newspaper said.\n\"Some temples are directly or indirectly controlled by the Dalai Lama clique and become the headquarters and venue of separatist forces at home and abroad,\" the newspaper said.\n\"Since 1987, elements creating disturbances and sabotaging stability have been mainly law-breaking monks and nuns.\"\nTibet has been rocked by repeated anti-Chinese protests that Beijing charges are stirred up by supporters of the Dalai Lama.\nThe newspaper also complained that monks did not contribute to economic growth.\n\"It goes without saying that such a large number of strong young people relying on alms from the masses and not engaging in productive work has a negative effect on social and economic development,\" the newspaper said.\n\"Money spent on renovating temples is more than money spent on building or repairing Communist Party and government buildings,\" it said.\nBeijing, eager not to antagonise all of the Buddhist clergy, has pumped 53 million yuan ($6.4 million) into its five-year renovation of the sprawling Potala Palace, winter home of the Dalai Lamas for centuries.\n","39":"A Chinese court has jailed a 56-year-old dissident for five years for subversion, dealing another blow to the country's tiny, struggling democracy movement.\nThe Intermediate People's Court in Xi'an city, in the northern province of Shaanxi, convicted Zhang Zong'ai this week of spreading \"counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement\", his lawyer, Zhang Jiankang, said on Saturday.\nThe dissident, detained since June, has appealed to the Shaanxi provincial Higher People's Court, the Hong Kong-based Human Rights and Democracy in China Information Centre said.\n\"Their (Chinese authorities) intention is to kill the chicken for the monkey to see... to frighten other dissidents,\" a spokesman for the centre, which monitors human rights abuses in China, said in a telephone interview.\nZhang was previously jailed for five years for demanding Premier Li Peng be impeached for ordering the military to crush student-led pro-democracy demonstrations centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989, the human rights watchdog said.\nHe lost his seat in the local lawmaking body along with his teaching job at the Xi'an Institute of Statistics and his wife divorced him after his incarceration in 1989, his family said.\nAsked to comment on Zhang's latest conviction, his sister, Zhang Xin, said he was innocent.\n\"He was wrongly accused,\" the sister said by telephone. \"He didn't commit any crime... He didn't do anything.\"\nHis lawyer told Reuters the court had found Zhang guilty of attacking China's judiciary in an interview with former student leader Wang Dan that was later published in a Hong Kong newspaper.\nWang, a former student leader of the 1989 democracy demonstrations, was sentenced to 11 years in prison last month for conspiring to subvert the government.\nThe court also found Zhang guilty of signing a petition last year urging authorities to show political tolerance, the lawyer said.\nThe court cleared Zhang of any wrongdoing in accepting money from an overseas group, the lawyer said. The court ruled Zhang did accept money but that he did not use the funds for counter-revolutionary activities.\nThe lawyer said the verdict also did not mention a charge in the bill of indictment that accused Zhang of \"pledging loyalty\" to the Taiwan authorities by writing to General Wego Chiang.\nChiang is the sole surviving son of the late Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, who fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949.

Hwang, the most senior official to defect from North Korea, arrived on Wednesday to seek asylum.\n\"They are harassing us and we are a little nervous about that,\" said South Korean embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik, adding that Seoul had asked Beijing to maintain tight security around the compound.\nChinese police moved away several North Koreans watching the compound from cars parked in side streets overnight, witnesses said.\n\"I still don't believe it,\" said one North Korean who drove up to the cordon on Friday. \"Judging from this situation and his position it is not possible for him to defect.\n\"If China allows him to go to South Korea then we will be disappointed,\" said the North Korean, who declined to identify himself. \"It will be regrettable.\"\nPyongyang has charged that Hwang, 73, one of the chief architects of North Korean communism, must have been kidnapped, and has called on Beijing to sort out the mess.\nSeoul has dismissed Pyongyang's charges that Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, was kidnapped, saying he arrived at the compound in a taxi on Wednesday.\nChina's Foreign Ministry said it had nothing to say on Friday on the diplomatic tussle in its backyard.\nIt was not clear whether Kim Ha-jung, a special adviser to South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha, would meet Chinese officials on Friday.\nKim failed to hold talks with Chinese officials when he arrived from Seoul on Thursday as Beijing, apparently angered by Seoul's decision to export its latest row with Pyongyang into China, avoided a meeting, South Korean sources said.\nHowever, he met the defector inside the compound.\nOfficials at the North Korean embassy refused to comment or confirm reports from Seoul that Pyongyang had sent a delegation led by an official at the level of vice-minister and including officials from the ruling Workers Party and the Foreign Ministry to discuss Hwang's defection.\nSouth and North Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953. China fought on North Korea's side in the conflict.\n","42":"Beijing's top negotiator with rival Taipei sought on Tuesday to allay Taiwan's fears that China would swallow up the island if Taipei lifts a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport links between the two.\n\"We feel this kind of strange logic is very ridiculous,\" Tang Shubei, vice-chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, said of Taiwan's concerns.\n\"We advocate that after reunification, 'you don't eat me up and I don't eat you up',\" he told reporters in his Beijing office.\nTaiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist troops lost the civil war to Mao Zedong's communist army in 1949 and fled into exile in Taiwan. Taiwan allows indirect links through Hong Kong or third countries.\nTaiwanese businessmen have poured more than $20 billion into China. Many of them have been clamouring for direct transport links, but Taiwan authorities are reluctant to lift the ban lest the island become an economic hostage to China.\nTang said scrapping the ban would help both sides and said Taiwan's losses would be greater than China's in the long run if it resisted direct links.\nChina unilaterally introduced a series of regulations in August to pave the way for direct shipping links with Taiwan. China first called on Taiwan to lift the ban 17 years ago.\nThe ban would in effect be scrapped in mid-1997 in any case when the British colony of Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule, Tang said, adding that Taiwanese aircraft and ships could continue to land and dock in Hong Kong.\nHe said the reunification of China and Taiwan would become a more glaring issue after the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau reverts to Chinese rule in 1999.\n\"The Taiwan problem will stand out in front of us after Hong Kong's return in 1997 and Macau's return in 1999,\" Tang said.\nTang said time and patience were needed for China and Taiwan to reunify, but declined to spell out a timetable.\n\"Time is needed to resolve the Taiwan problem. We have adequate patience,\" he said, but urged Taiwan not to seek to declare independence. Beijing has threatened to invade if Taiwan declared independence.\nHe renewed an offer to hold political talks to end almost five decades of animosity. \"Political differences must be resolved (through) political talks,\" Tang said.\nBut Tang said Taiwan must first abandon its attempt to break out of diplomatic isolation.\nBeijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into isolation.\nTies between Beijing and Taipei plunged after the landmark, private visit by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui to the United States in June 1995 that China saw as a move to raise the island's international profile.\nChina's military conducted missile tests and war games off Taiwan before the island's first direct presidential elections last March, which Lee won by a landslide.\nLast week, China accused Taiwan of standing in the way of reunification by creating obstacles to economic and trade cooperation, saying the island was \"squashing its own feet with a rock\" by refusing to end the ban.\n","43":"China said on Sunday its soaring stock markets were overheating on widespread speculation and warned of a crash similar to the great Wall Street collapse of 1929.\n\"Currently, China's stock markets are overheated, making us associate it with the U.S. stock disaster in 1929,\" the official People's Daily newspaper said in a commentary, issued in advance of its Monday edition by the Xinhua news agency.\nChina's foreign currency B share market in Shanghai soared by about 80 percent between November 11 and December 10 while the bourse in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen rose by about 100 percent before sharp falls in the final days of last week.\nThe Shanghai B-share market plunged 12.26 percent on Friday while its Shenzhen counterpart dived 14.75 percent.

Many suspects had been released after questioning, officials said.\nThe death toll could rise, with up to seven people listed as missing, the party official said. About 90 people were treated for head wounds, and more than 10 were still in hospital.\nOf the injured, 132 were civilians while the remaining 12 were members of the paramilitary People's Armed Police, a spokesman for the Xinjiang regional government said.\nAbout 1,000 people, mostly Uighur farmers or unemployed young men, rioted in Yining last week in one of the largest and most violent demonstrations for independence in the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang since the 1949 communist takeover.\nTurkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority in Xinjiang, where ethnic Han Chinese make up 38 percent of the population.\n\"We don't want the Communist Party,\" the demonstrators had chanted, witnesses said.\nUighur demonstrators had attacked Han Chinese with bricks, clubs and knives, and rampaged through the town, smashing and setting fire to about 20 vehicles and looting shops.\nThe People's Armed Police only succeeded in dispersing the rioters a day later, firing teargas to break up the crowd.\nAuthorities had sealed off Yining, an after-dark curfew was in force in some districts and armed police still patrolled the streets. The airport would reopen on Friday, officials said.\nA Chinese source said the riot erupted after a Uighur criminal suspect resisted arrest by police.\nYusupbek Mukhlisi, leader of the United National Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan based in Kazakhstan, said the riot was sparked by the execution of 30 Uighurs in China last week. Chinese officials dismissed the report.\nYining is 50 km (30 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan, where many exiled Uighur separatists live.\nXinjiang authorities last year stepped up a crackdown on separatists and underground religious activity after clashes, bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.\n","45":"China's exports climbed again in October as slow demand at home encouraged companies to ship abroad and the government expanded credit to exporters, newspapers and a government economist said Wednesday.\nThe upturn was expected to continue through the first half of 1997, said Wang Jian, a researcher with the cabinet's State Planning Commission.\nExports rose for the fourth consecutive month in October, jumping 23.3 percent to $15.22 billion from a year ago, said the International Business Daily, a newspaper published by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe performance helped the nation register its biggest monthly trade surplus of the year. The surplus stood at $3.9 billion in October compared with $3.2 billion in September, the newspaper said.\n\"This kind of rebound in exports ... is estimated to last until the first half of next year,\" Wang said in a telephone interview. Wang said slow domestic demand has forced manufacturers to look to overseas markets.\nAlso, domestic enterprises had adjusted to a cut in government-paid export tax rebates, he said. The government slashed the rebate on exports of industrial products to 9.0 percent from 14.0 percent on January 1, 1996.\nThe International Business Daily said exports rebounded because the government sped up the payment of export tax rebates and expanded credit to exporters.\nExports slumped in the first six months of 1996, dented by rising wages and the relative strength of the currency.\nA slowdown in government payments of tax rebates to exporters had also discouraged many firms from exporting their goods earlier in the year. Many of those firms focused sales on the domestic market instead.\nHowever, the government has been stepping up payment of export rebates to try to revive exports.\nImports inched up 3 percent to $11.31 billion in October from October 1995, the Business Daily said.\nThe import data showed that the impact of this year's tariff cuts has gradually weakened, it said.\nIn the first 10 months of this year, China's exports totalled $119.22 billion, mostly unchanged from the same 1995 period, the newspaper said. But imports added up to $107.21 billion, a rise of 5.5 percent from the year-ago period.\nJapan, the United States and Europe remained China's largest export markets.\nChina's exports to Japan rose a year-on-year 8.6 percent to $24.5 billion in the first 10 months of this year, the daily said. Exports to the United States and Europe increased 5.5 percent and 4.5 percent to $21.3 billion and $18.9 billion respectively.\n","46":"China hit out at Britain on Thursday, saying London's protests against Beijing's proposed amendments to Hong Kong laws after this year's handover of sovereignty were unacceptable, unreasonable and unwise.\n\"We cannot accept the British protest, it is also totally unreasonable and the so-called protest is unwise,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing.\n\"The British side is always forcing its will upon others and this will not work,\" Shen said, adding that Hong Kong was China's internal affair after the handover and no other country had the right to interfere.\nBritain lodged a strong protest on Wednesday against Beijing's plans to dilute laws guaranteeing civil liberties in Hong Kong when it regains control of the colony on July 1 after more than 150 years of British rule.\nThe Foreign Office said junior minister Jeremy Hanley had expressed Britain's \"serious concern\" over the proposals at a meeting with Chinese ambassador Jiang Enzhu.\nA spokesman said Hanley told the envoy that Hong Kong's bill of rights and related legislation, which China wants to amend, were fully consistent with the Basic Law -- the post-handover constitution for Hong Kong promulgated by Beijing in 1990.\nChina has accused Britain of violating the Basic Law by unilaterally introducing laws guaranteeing civil liberties in Hong Kong after the handover.\nShen, the Chinese spokesman, defended China's plan to amend or repeal a list of 25 laws and ordinances, saying China was merely reversing unilateral changes made by Britain.\n\"It is fair and reasonable,\" Shen said of the proposed amendments.\nBeijing is moving to replace Hong Kong's elected Legislative Council with a provisional legislature and block a lenient law that would exclude China-style crackdowns on dissent.\nShen charged that Patten's expansion of the electoral process in Hong Kong in violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the handover was undemocratic.\n\"I think that violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration cannot be considered as something democratic,\" Shen said. \"We are upholding the solemnity of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.\"\nA Chinese envoy to Hong Kong blamed the British protest on Patten, the 28th and last British governor of Hong Kong.\n\"This was an angry act by Chris Patten who was ashamed that his long-time confrontation with China had been unfruitful,\" Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of Xinhua News Agency, China's de facto diplomatic mission in Hong Kong, told reporters in the colony.\nChina's opponents say its planned steps fly in the face of vows that allow Hong Kong to keep its freedoms after it becomes a Special Administrative Region of China.\nPatten has called Beijing's moves a \"legal nonsense\" while pro-democracy groups said it was a blow to democracy and human rights that would dent overseas confidence in Hong Kong.\nDonald Tsang, who is responsible for drafting a budget for wealthy Hong Kong that straddles the transition, said China would need to convince investors the changes were necessary.\n\"If you can't convince the people of Hong Kong, people may take to the streets, some may keep their frustration in their hearts, some in the civil service may quit. Some may emigrate,\" he told the South China Morning Post newspaper.\nThe United States expressed strong concern on Tuesday and called on China to reconsider its moves.\n","47":"A Chinese court has agreed to hear a lawsuit by veteran dissident Liu Nianchun accusing the government of illegal incarceration, but finding a defence lawyer has been difficult, Liu's wife said on Thursday.\nAlthough Beijing's Chaoyang District Court has accepted the lawsuit, Liu's family has no money and several lawyers have come under government pressure not to take up the dissident's case, Chu Hailan said in a telephone interview.\nIn a separate case, Beijing's Dongcheng District Court has agreed to hear Wang Hui's lawsuit accusing police of illegally detaining her for unspecified reasons from May 16 to June 13, Wang told Reuters.\nWang, wife of jailed poet and dissident Zhou Guoqiang, also accused five guards at a detention centre in Changping county near Beijing, where she was held, of beating her up after the guards had been drinking.\nShe demanded 10,000 yuan ($1,200) in compensation, a public apology from the authorities and punishment of the guards.\nNo trial dates have been set. The courts declined to comment.\nChinese courts rarely agree to accept lawsuits filed by dissidents or their relatives. But acceptance of the case was only the first hurdle.\n\"It's very difficult to hire a lawyer. There are all sorts of pressures...and they (lawyers) are worried about their careers,\" Liu's wife said. \"Also, lawyers are expensive. I can't afford them.\"\n\"I'm pessimistic...winning is impossible,\" she said.\nInternational human rights groups have accused China's judiciary of serving as tools to persecute dissidents.\nWang, the poet's wife, was adamant. \"I'm not afraid of being jailed again for suing them,\" she said.\nShe demanded Chinese authorities allow her husband to visit his 74-year-old mother, who is in hospital with lung cancer.\nWang said she would consider dropping her lawsuit if the authorities allowed her husband, who is suffering from kidney infection, to seek medical treatment at a hospital.\nDissidents Liu, 48, and Zhou, 41, are both serving three year sentences of re-education through labour at a camp in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, although Zhou has been given an additional year for an unsuccessful escape attempt.\nRe-education through labour is an administrative punishment that can be imposed by the authorities without recourse to prosecutors or the courts.\nChinese authorities appear to have begun favouring the administrative punishment as a way to remove dissidents from circulation without the complicated process of a judicial trial.\nThe New York-based Human Rights in China, which monitors the human rights situation on the mainland, applauded the court's decision to hear Liu's lawsuit, but warned against perfunctory treatment.\n\"Liu's case must not be given the perfunctory treatment which has always been given to dissidents' lawsuits against the government in the past,\" the group said.\n","48":"Taiwanese business leader Kao Ching-yuan on Wednesday urged Beijing to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island's investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded relations.\n\"If the relations between the two sides are kept at a low ebb due to political and ideological problems... Taiwanese businessmen will lose confidence because of higher risks,\" said Kao, vice-chairman of President Enterprises, Taiwan's biggest investor in China.\nChinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing earlier told the same seminar in Beijing no one could stand in the way of direct trade and transport links between China and Taiwan which have been banned by the island since 1949.\nKao is heading a delegation of nearly 80 prominent Taiwanese business leaders and politicians who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a high-profile visit. Taiwanese economic officials are visiting in a private capacity.\nKao called for the resumption of talks suspended last year after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark trip to the United States. Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.\n\"I would like to suggest here... that the two sides resume as soon as possible talks on trade and investment,\" Kao said.\nTaiwanese newspapers said Kao would meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other senior officials during the current trip, which comes less than two weeks after President Lee called for a review of economic policy toward China with the aim of avoiding overdependence on the mainland.\nTaipei's China Times Express newspaper said on Sunday that Taiwan's economic planners had drawn up measures -- including contingency plans to restrict Taiwanese investment on the mainland -- if Taiwan-China relations deteriorated.\nLi, the Chinese vice-premier, took a swipe at President Lee, saying no one could block direct trade and transport links between China and Taiwan, rivals from the time of the Chinese civil war that ended in 1949.\n\"Economic development between the two sides is the general trend and no single person can obstruct this,\" Li said.\n\"Any person who tries to place artificial barriers to restrict economic cooperation is going against the will of the people of the two sides,\" he said.\nHe also told the seminar he hoped Taiwan authorities would allow direct links as soon as possible.\nIndirect links between the two sides have been allowed since the late 1980s, through Hong Kong or a third country.\nMany Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport links. But Taiwan has been reluctant to lift the ban, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.\nChina has been pressing Taiwan to open direct links. Last week, China introduced a series of regulations to pave the way for direct shipping links.\nThe Taiwanese delegation is the largest to visit China since a trend of easing tensions was reversed by Taiwan President Lee's mid-1995 visit to the United States.\n","49":"China on Thursday savoured its latest victory in a diplomatic tug-of-war with Taiwan, while the stunned island scrambled to limit the damage from South Africa's decision to abandon it.\nSouth African President Nelson Mandela said in Johannesburg on Wednesday that Pretoria would switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing by the end of 1997.\nBeijing hailed the move, saying it was in South Africa's interest.\n\"We ...welcome President Mandela's positive statement concerning normalisation of relations between China and South Africa,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing in Beijing.\n\"If South Africa can recognise reality at an earlier date it is in its own interest to do so,\" Cui said.\nBeijing and Taipei have been diplomatic rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.\nChina regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation. Taiwan insists its 21 million people should have a voice in international affairs.\nSouth Africa is the biggest of just 30 states that recognise Taiwan's exiled Republic of China rather than the communist People's Republic on the mainland.\nThe Chinese government spokesman said the People's Republic was the sole, legitimate government of all China.\n\"South Africa must recognise there is only one China, recognise that Taiwan is a part of China and sever so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan,\" Cui said.\nWealthy but diplomatically isolated Taiwan was stunned by Mandela's announcement and scrambled to limit the damage by urging its 29 other allies not to be swayed by China.\n\"We hope such a situation won't affect our diplomatic relations with other countries...,\" Taiwan's Foreign Minister John Chang said in a televised news conference in Taipei.\n\"We will actively negotiate with South Africa in the next 12 months,\" Chang said, adding that he might visit South Africa before an official visit scheduled for January.\nSouth Africa's Ambassador to Taiwan Johannes Viljoen urged the island not to exact reprisals against Pretoria.\nBut Taiwan's top economic planner said the island would not continue to encourage investment in South Africa.\nTuntex, one of the island's major business groups, said earlier on Thursday it would respect the government's wishes in deciding whether to move ahead with a planned $3 billion petrochemical project in South Africa.\nTaiwan officials said they would conduct an overall review of Taiwanese investments in South Africa, currently totalling over $1.5 billion.\nSouth Africa's decision to switch ties to China sent Taiwan stocks into a brief dive, but the market had recovered by the close. Many businesssmen played down any potential for serious, long-term harm.\nThe Taiwan dollar closed little changed against its U.S. counterpart despite news of the island's diplomatic setback.\nTaiwanese officials blamed China for South Africa's decision to ditch Taiwan, saying China was \"buying\" foreign ties and damaging chances for reunification between the longtime rivals.\nThere were no protests at Pretoria's embassy in Taipei, contrasting with the public outrage displayed in previous years after Washington, Seoul and other former allies dropped Taipei for Beijing.\n","50":"China's exports climbed again in October due to sluggish domestic demand, faster payment of export tax rebates and an expansion of credit to exporters, newspapers and a government economist said on Wednesday.\nThe upturn in exports was expected to continue through the first half of 1997, said Wang Jian, a researcher with the cabinet's State Planning Commission.\nExports rose for the fourth consecutive month in October, jumping 23.3 percent to $15.22 billion from a year ago, said the International Business Daily, a newspaper published by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe healthy exports performance helped the nation register its biggest monthly trade surplus of the year. The surplus stood at $3.91 billion in October compared with $3.2 billion in September, the newspaper said.\n\"This kind of rebound in exports ... is estimated to last until the first half of next year,\" Wang told Reuters in a telephone interview.\nWang attributed the upturn to slow domestic demand, forcing manufacturers to look to overseas markets.\nAlso, domestic enterprises had adjusted to a cut in government-paid export tax rebates, he said. The government slashed the rebate on exports of industrial products to 9.0 percent from 14.0 percent on January 1, 1996.\nThe International Business Daily said exports rebounded because the government sped up the payment of export tax rebates and expanded credit to exporters.\nExports slumped in the first six months of 1996, dented by rising wages and the relative strength of the currency, the renminbi.\nA slowdown in government payments of tax rebates to exporters had also discouraged many firms from exporting their goods earlier in the year. Many of those firms focused sales on the domestic market instead.\nHowever, the government has been stepping up payment of export rebates to try to revive exports.\nImports inched up a year-on-year three percent to $11.31 billion in October, the Business Daily said.\nThe import data showed that the impact of this year's tariff cuts has gradually weakened, it said.\nIn the first 10 months of this year, China's exports totalled $119.22 billion, mostly unchanged from the same 1995 period, the newspaper said. But imports added up to $107.21 billion, a rise of 5.5 percent from the year-ago period.\nThe latest figures brought the total trade surplus for the January-to-October period to $12.01 billion, it said.\nJapan, the United States and Europe remained China's largest export markets.\nChina's exports to Japan rose a year-on-year 8.6 percent to $24.5 billion in the first 10 months of this year, the daily said. Exports to the United States and Europe increased 5.5 percent and 4.5 percent to $21.3 billion and $18.9 billion respectively.\nMachinery and electronic exports totalled $38 billion in the first 10 months, accounting for one-third of total exports and up 11 percent from the year-ago period, the newspaper said.\nExports of toys, furniture, shoes, crude oil and plastic products increased in the first 10 months. But exports of textile yarn and related products, garment, steel and aquatic products all fell, it said.\nImports by foreign-funded enterprises in the first 10 months soared a year-on-year 23 percent to $105.0 billion.\nCar imports plunged 39 percent year-on-year between January and October, the newspaper said. It did not elaborate.\n","51":"China's Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin, in a renewed overture to rival Taiwan, urged the island not to set up new obstacles to ties, major Chinese newspapers said on Friday.\n\"The Taiwan authorities...must not artificially set up new obstacles,\" Jiang was quoted as saying on Thursday, one day after the election of the first post-colonial chief executive of Hong Kong. He did not elaborate.\nHong Kong is due to revert to China at midnight on June 30, 1997 after 150 years of British rule.\nJiang took the occasion of the naming of Hong Kong's future chief executive to urge Taiwan to return to the fold.\n\"Completing reunification of the motherland is the will of the people and an historical inevitability,\" Jiang said.\nMajor newspapers carried the full text of Jiang's speech.\nBeijing and Taipei have been rivals since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops lost the Chinese civil war to the communists and fled into exile on the island in 1949.\nThe end of the Chiang dynasty in 1988 and the rise of Taiwan's first native-born president, Lee Teng-hui, has brought Western-style democracy -- anathema to Beijing's communists -- to Taiwan.\nBeijing suspects Lee is trying to push Taiwan towards independence. Taiwan denies any independence ambitions and says it is still committed to reunification, albeit under democracy and a free market economy.\nJiang renewed a call for \"political talks\" to iron out differences and pave the way for reunification.\nHe said forces clamouring for Taiwan's independence threatened peaceful reunification.\n\"The Communist Party of China... will not allow any person, any force to split Taiwan from the motherland,\" Jiang said.\nChina has threatened to invade if Taiwan declared independence. It held war games and missile tests near the island in March in the run-up to its first direct presidential elections, which Lee won by a landslide.\n\"Our determination is unwavering,\" Jiang said in a speech to mark the 60th anniversary of the kidnapping of Chiang Kai-shek in the ancient capital of Xian.\nChang Hsueh-liang, dubbed the \"young marshal,\" abducted Chiang Kai-shek 60 years ago to force him to fight invading Japanese troops instead of focusing on his rivalry with the communists.\nBeijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation, but Taipei has continued to flirt with Beijing's allies.\nFiji President Kamisese Mara arrived in Taiwan on Thursday for a six-day official visit.\nBeijing scored a big victory in its quest to isolate Taiwan when South Africa said in November it would switch recognition to Beijing from Taipei by the end of 1997.\nQiao Shi, chairman of China's National People's Congress, or parliament, called for the early normalisation of relations between China and South Africa during a meeting with a visiting delegation of the African National Congress on Thursday, the Xinhua news agency said.\n","52":"The trial of prominent Chinese dissident and former student leader Wang Dan for the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government is expected to be held behind closed doors soon, a family member said on Tuesday.\nThe Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court had yet to inform Wang's family of the trial date, the relative said.\nThe court was widely expected to fill the limited number of courtroom seats with carefully selected people to keep away foreign reporters and fellow dissidents.\n\"Only the people notified by the court can attend the trial. Others cannot attend,\" the family member said in a telephone interview.\n\"In reality, the trial will not be open...but the court will not admit it is not an open trial,\" the relative said. \"It tells a group of people to attend and calls this an open trial.\"\nA court official, contacted by telephone, declined to comment.\nIf last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement, was an indication, Wang's trial would be kept from public view, a political activist said. Dissidents and foreign reporters were barred from Wei's trial.\nCourt officials have confirmed that Wang, detained since May 1995, has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government -- a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death and a minimum of 10 years in prison.\nThey have not given further details of the trial though one official said that Wang could appeal to the Higher People's Court if convicted.\nRelatives said last week they had found a lawyer willing to defend Wang after being given one day to find one.\nWang's mother, Wang Lingyun, a 61-year-old museum researcher who has no background in law, has said she would defend her son in court. Chinese law allows an accused to be defended by a family member.\nIt also states that only lawyers can meet detained defendants. Wang's mother was allowed to meet the dissident at a detention centre in Beijing on Monday because she was his legal counsel.\nThe dissident was mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, Wang's mother told a Hong Kong-based group that monitors human rights in China.\n\"Wang Dan said he has not done anything wrong...He is very calm...and psychologically prepared for a heavy sentence,\" the group quoted the mother as saying.\n\"She is very worried about his health,\" the group said.\nIt added that Wang had back, throat and prostate problems.\n\"In the condition that Wang Dan is in, it would be difficult for him to hold out under another long prison sentence,\" it quoted the mother as saying.\nWang, 26, has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nWang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted Wei Jingsheng implicated Wang.\nThe verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people \"convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan\". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.\nWang had been active after his parole in 1993, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.\n","53":"A group of 56 Chinese writers, former officials and academics has petitioned Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin to save cultural relics from the gigantic Three Gorges dam which would flood huge tracts of land.\nAncient tombs and temples were threatened by a dearth of government funds and official under-reporting of those relics that warranted saving, according to the letter, a copy of which was made available to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\"The hearts of relic protection departments are like burning fire with 10,000 worries and misgivings,\" it said of the lack of funds.\nAbout 130 historical sites, some of them dating to the Stone Age, could be flooded as soon as next year.\nThe sites include Qing dynasty (1644-1911) temples, an entire street from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and stone carvings from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220).\nRelocation of many relics had been delayed due to lack of funds, the letter said, adding that the damage would worsen unless government funds for relocation were provided.\nThe letter dated August 8 was signed by prominent female writer Bing Xin, former ambassador to the United States Chai Zemin and former minister of culture Wang Meng.\nOthers include Su Bingqi, president of the Archaeological Society, and Yu Weichao, curator of the Museum of Chinese History who is in charge of relocating relics.\nArchaeologists had designated 829 buried relics near a reservoir under construction as needing protection. The sites covered a total area of more than 20 million square metres (215 million square ft), but the government has agreed to protect one tenth of the area due to a lack of funds, it said.\nSome ancient tombs and relics have already disappeared under the onslaught of bulldozers, the letter said.\nConstruction of the controversial dam was expected to submerge 632 square km (244 square miles) of land in central China's Hubei province and the southwestern province of Sichuan.\nIt would force the relocation of 840,000 people from up to 200 villages and towns, according to 1991-92 estimates.\nEnvironmentalists have described the project as a potential ecological disaster, leading to the destruction of a scenic mountain region and the extinction of endangered species.\nThe Three Gorges dam -- the world's biggest water control project --  was expected to ease seasonal flooding by creating a massive reservoir in Hubei to store waters from rains.\nThe 6,000-km (3,500-mile) Yangtze river -- China's longest -- and its tributaries have triggered floods throughout much of China's history.\nThe project, expected to cost $30 billion by its completion in 2009, would also help ease China's crippling shortage of electric power.\n","54":"China vowed on Tuesday to intensify a crackdown on economic disorder in 1997, citing tax evasion, financial irregularities, smuggling and counterfeiting as some ills that cost the state billions of dollars a year.\n\"Basically, the situation of economic disorder still has not changed. Some problems are even considerably serious,\" the official People's Daily said in a commentary.\nChinese authorities uncovered tax, auditing and pricing violations valued at 161 billion yuan ($19.4 billion) in the past 11 years, or an average of 14.6 billion yuan a year, the commentary said.\n\"Increasing the intensity of regulating and revamping economic order has become an important mission which brooks no delay,\" the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party said.\n\"We cannot be soft when dealing a blow to various economic crimes,\" the commentary said.\nTax evasion and smuggling were now rife, springing up along with market-oriented economic reforms introduced by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s.\nState media said taxpayers had evaded personal income tax worth an estimated 12 billion yuan since the tax was introduced in 1980.\nUp to 60 percent of state-run or collective firms in China evaded taxes, the media said. It gave no figures.\n\"Many enterprises have two sets of accounting books and fabricate financial statements, budgets, sales and asset appraisal,\" the commentary said.\nChinese companies owed 35.7 billion yuan in industrial and commercial taxes in the first 11 months of 1996, up 72.9 percent from the year-ago period, Xinhua news agency said.\nBeijing collected 563.9 billion yuan in industrial and commercial taxes in the first 11 months, up 1995 percent from the year-ago period.\nSmuggling of goods, ranging from drugs to stolen cars, was rampant in China's thriving and porous coastal areas and inland border regions.\nChinese customs seized 5.6 billion yuan worth of smuggled goods in the first six months of 1996, latest figures showed. No comparative figures were available.\nCheng Xiusheng, an economist with the Development Research Centre under the cabinet, said economic disorder was inevitable as China abandoned central planning and embraced market reforms.\nThe authorities have reined in galloping inflation, allowing them to now turn their attention to restoring economic order, Cheng said.\n\"It can be said that inflation is under control... The next step is to revamp economic order,\" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.\nThe People's Daily said financial irregularities, including financial institutions paying exorbitant interest rates and extending huge loans to loss-making state-owned enterprises, have been \"repeatedly banned but do not stop\".\nCounterfeiting and piracy were common and almost led to a trade war between China and the United States in February 1995 and June this year. China has declared war on piracy and clamped down on manufacturers of pirated compact discs.\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)\n","55":"China will defrock radical monks in Tibet in a crackdown that could last up to five years in a bid to uproot the influence of the Dalai Lama in his Himalayan homeland, a Chinese propaganda official said on Thursday.\n\"Lamas who are comparatively reactionary will be told to return to secular life,\" the propaganda official said by telephone from Tibet's capital, Lhasa.\n\"Reorganisation of monasteries... will consist mainly of ideological education... It could continue for three to five years,\" said the official, who declined to identify himself.\nChina has vowed to curb the influence of Buddhism and the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled god-king, in the region, saying religion must conform to socialism instead of the other way round.\nAtheist China views religion as feudal superstition though it tolerates a limited degree of religious freedom.\n\"Religious culture... not only hampers social development and economic development, but also stops people becoming more civilised,\" the official Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Thursday.\nThe newspaper complained last week that monks in Tibet outnumbered students and more money was spent on monasteries than on Communist Party buildings.\n\"Monasteries will not be closed... (but) work teams will enter and be stationed at monasteries,\" the propaganda official said.\nFor several months, China has been stationing \"work teams\" in Tibetan monasteries. The teams force monks into study sessions on becoming more \"patriotic\" and into signing pledges supporting Chinese authorities.\n\"Those aspects of religion which fail to adapt to social development and impede social progress will be eliminated... to prevent the Dalai Lama from using religion to engage in splittist activities,\" the official said.\nThere were 1,787 temples in Tibet by early 1996, with 46,000 monks and nuns -- exceeding the number of high school students in the region, the Tibet Daily has said.\nThe newspaper has complained that healthy young Tibetans were entering the clergy and living off alms instead of working.\nChina has shut many temples in Tibet in recent years to try to eradicate the influence of the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule.\nThe Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, but Beijing views international support for Tibet's holiest man as a Western plot to split China and contain its development.\nBeijing says the Dalai Lama is a political activist and not a purely religious figure.\n\"The spiritual realm is the main battlefield of our struggle against the Dalai Lama clique,\" the Tibet Daily said.\nThe newspaper said last week some temples in Tibet were controlled by supporters of the Dalai Lama and had become the headquarters and venue of separatist forces at home and abroad to engage in separatist activities.\nIt blamed monks and nuns for creating disturbances and sabotaging stability since 1987. Tibet has been rocked by repeated anti-Chinese protests that Beijing charges are stirred up by the Dalai Lama's supporters.\n","56":"China announced on Thursday that a court had rejected the appeal by a son of one of the country's politically powerful families, upholding a suspended death sentence for bribery.\nThe court showed leniency to Zhou Beifang, 43, former chairman of Hong Kong-listed affiliates of the giant state-owned Capital Iron and Steel Corp (Shougang), because he showed remorse, the official Xinhua news agency said.\nZhou's death sentence was suspended for two years. Such suspensions usually mean the sentence will not be carried out if the prisoner repents and cooperates with authorities.\nZhou is one of China's so-called \"princelings\", or children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence due to their top level connections.\nThe Zhou family has close ties to the family of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\nThe court also showed leniency because Zhou voluntarily returned ill-gotten wealth even before prosecutors obtained evidence against him, Xinhua said.\nZhou was convicted of accepting bribes totalling 9.28 million Hong Kong dollars ($1.2 million) between June 1993 and April 1994, Xinhua said. It gave no details of who paid Zhou the bribes or why.\nHe was also found guilty of paying 1.2 million yuan ($144,600) in bribes to three people, including two former officials of the Beijing city government, so that his wife and daughter could move to the British colony, it said.\nXinhua quoted the Supreme Court as announcing the decision though it was the appeals court that handed down the verdict.\nThe agency gave no explanation. It did not say when Zhou was convicted, when he appealed or why his appeal was turned down.\nCourt officials reached by telephone declined comment.\nState television showed a grim Zhou wearing a stylish, striped blue shirt and examining documents held by a court policeman as a court tribunal looked on.\nZhou's conviction was part of a highly-publicised anti-graft campaign launched by China last year. It led to the suicide of a Beijing vice-mayor in April 1995 and the fall of his mentor, former Beijing Communist Party boss Chen Xitong.\nZhou's father, Zhou Guanwu, 78, resigned as chairman and Communist Party secretary of Shougang in February 1995, citing old age. He stepped down days after his son's detention.\nThe court also rejected the appeal of co-defendant Chen Jian, 39, former deputy director of the General Office of the Communist Party's Beijing Municipal Committee. It upheld his 15-year prison sentence for accepting bribes from Zhou, Xinhua said.\nAnother former official of the Beijing city government, Li Min, did not appeal against his sentence of life imprisonment, also for accepting bribes from Zhou, the agency said.\nIn a related case, the court rejected the appeal of businessman He Shiping, who was sentenced to 16 years for accepting bribes. A fifth defendant, who was given five years in prison, did not appeal, it said.\nTelevision showed lengthy footage that include Li staring at the floor and a dejected He Shiping wiping tears from his eyes.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949. But it has staged a comeback since economic reforms were introduced 17 years ago as living standards climb but at the cost of eroding party discipline.\n","57":"Two sons of Beijing's disgraced Communist Party boss, Chen Xitong, have been detained and face possible prosecution for economic crimes, Chinese sources said on Friday.\nThe fate of Chen himself was unknown. He was one of the most powerful men in China before his fall in April 1995 after one of his proteges, Beijing Vice-Mayor Wang Baosen, came under investigation for economic crimes and committed suicide.\n\"It all depends on the (party's) Central Commission for Discipline Inspection...(which) is investigating Chen Xitong,\" one source said in reference to whether the commission would hand Chen's case over to courts for prosecution.\nCourt officials, reached by telephone, declined to comment.\n\"This is a test of whether the government's anti-corruption drive is for real,\" the source said told Reuters. Critics say the campaign targets only petty officials.\nTwo sources with ties to the party said Chen's eldest son, Chen Xiaoxi, and younger son, Chen Xiaotong, were being held at the Qincheng Prison in a northern suburb of Beijing and faced possible prosecution.\nThe younger son has been in custody since last year but it was unclear when the older son was detained.\nThe sources said they were uncertain over precisely what charges might be filed against either of the two.\nPrison guards were transferred to Beijing from other provinces to ensure the two men remained under tight security. Beijing was the political powerbase of the family.\nOutlook magazine, published by the official Xinhua news agency, said this month that Chen Xitong's case \"will not just fade away\".\nChen Xitong, 66, has not been seen in public since April 1995 when he resigned as Beijing's Communist Party boss. He was ousted from the party's powerful Politburo in September 1995, becoming the most senior victim of a crackdown on corruption.\nChen, who was promoted to the Politburo in recognition of his hardline stand against student-led demonstrations for democracy in Beijing in 1989, is believed to be under virtual house arrest. He is officially said to be under investigation for \"serious mistakes\".\nUnpublished party documents have said Chen, who ran Beijing for 12 years, first as mayor and then as party boss, had abused his office by amassing $24 million in unauthorised funds and lavishing favours on friends, associates and a mistress.\nChen gave nine flats around Beijing to his mistress and her relatives, according to the documents.\nIn December 1995, Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa shed light on Chen's whereabouts. Zhang said: \"His life is better than mine... He plays table tennis...eats what he wants.\"\nA second source quoted official documents as saying the younger son illegally channelled government funds to his father's mistress, He Ping.\nThe younger son, a former executive of a Sino-Japanese joint venture hotel in Beijing, also tipped off his father's mistress about the vice-mayor's suicide and told her to go to Hong Kong and not come back, the source said.\nThe brothers are among China's so-called \"princelings\", or children of the ruling party elite who enjoy wide influence due to their top level connections.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.\n","58":"A son-in-law of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping has resigned as director of the armament department of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), Chinese sources with close ties to the military said on Sunday.\nMajor General He Ping, husband of Deng's youngest daughter Deng Rong, quit the post recently after his hopes for promotion were dashed, one source said.\n\"He Ping was unhappy... He wanted to become deputy chief of general staff, but the Central Military Commission would only make him assistant chief of general staff initially,\" the source, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.\nThe assistant chief of general staff is one rank below the deputy chief of general staff.\nAnother source said a replacement had been named to succeed He Ping as director of the armament department, which supplies equipment to the three million-strong PLA.\nThe commission's refusal to give Deng's son-in-law the post he wanted was not so much a blow to the first family as it was a boost to the position of Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin.\n\"It was not so much as a challenge to Deng Xiaoping. Rather, it was a sign that Jiang Zemin is now more powerful,\" the second source said.\nThe first source agreed. \"Jiang Zemin does not have to do everything Deng Xiaoping says,\" the source said of the commission's decision not to promote He Ping to deputy chief of general staff.\nJiang, who is chairman of the commission, has moved in recent years to shore up his position by appointing allies to key military positions and shrug off Deng's shadow.\nDeng, 92, no longer holds any office but remains highly influential. He has not been seen in public since early 1994.\nThe paramount leader vouched for his son-in-law, whose company was alleged to have been involved in the smuggling of the biggest haul of automatic weapons in U.S. history.\n\"Deng Xiaoping spoke. He said: 'It was not He Ping's fault'... He Ping does not have any more problems,\" the first source said of the arms smuggling scandal.\n\"It was a trap by the United States,\" the source said of the arms seizure. Many communist officials harbour deep suspicions of the United States and the view that the arms seizure was a U.S. conspiracy to undermine China.\nChina's two top government-run arms merchants, Polytechnologies Ltd and China North Industries Corp (Norinco), have rejected U.S. charges they were involved in the scandal.\nHe Ping is president of Poly Group, which is owned by the PLA's armament department. Poly Group subsidiary Polytechnologies is a joint venture with China's flagship multinational China International Trust and Investment Co and headed by Wang Jun, son of a late vice-president and close associate of Deng.\nNorinco is a civilian organisation that has no direct relationship with the army but supplies it with arms.\nIn March, U.S. federal agents seized a shipment of 2,000 AK-47 fully automatic machine guns and 4,000 ammunition magazines, with a street value of more than $4 million.\nU.S. agents arrested at least seven people, including executives of Norinco, in May and charged them with involvement in the ring.\nThe seizure was the culmination of a 16-month investigation of senior officials, based in both the United States and China, of Norinco and Polytechnologies.\nThe suspects had offered to sell much more powerful weapons to undercover agents, including mortars, rocket launchers, machineguns and a surface-to-air missile, U.S. officials have said.\n","59":"China pledged on Wednesday to curb a rush by provinces to invest in high-profile industries, but economists said defiance from regional authorities would impede attempts by the central government to restructure the economy.\nThe People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, said many new state enterprises were doomed from the beginning due to blind investment in many provinces.\n\"From the day production began, (many enterprises) entered a vicious cycle of high investment, high consumption of resources, low production efficiency and poor management,\" the newspaper said in a front-page commentary.\nMany old enterprises, unable to upgrade their technology, lose their competitive edge and become inefficient, it said.\nThe newspaper said blind investment was widespread, citing 22 provinces that listed car production as one of their pillar industries in their Five-Year Plan between 1996 and 2000 and the plan for 2010.\nTwenty-four provinces listed electronics as one of their pillar industries through 2000, and 16 provinces said they would concentrate on machinery and chemicals, the newspaper said.\n\"This has been a major problem for China's economy for a long time,\" economist Mao Tianqi said in a telephone interview when asked about the blind investment.\nBlind investment had also led to monopolies and local protectionism, with many provinces banning competitive products from neighbouring regions, the newspaper said.\nIt said China's economic structure was \"unreasonable\", with too many small enterprises, not enough large enterprises, too many low-end products and insufficient high technology items.\nThe central government planned to restructure the economy next year to curb concentration in high-profile industries and to boost efficiency, the newspaper said.\n\"Restructuring the economy...is a mission of extreme importance,\" it said.\nThe central government would try to divert investment into the manufacturing of products with big demand as well as high technology products, the newspaper said. It did not elaborate.\nThe government would try to break monopolies by encouraging joint ventures among provinces, the newspaper said, adding that business groups would be encouraged to shed affiliates that are not related to production, such as hospitals and kindergartens.\n\"There are many difficulties and contradictions in adjusting and improving the economic structure, but...the State Council's (cabinet's) determination will not waver,\" the newspaper said.\nBut economist Mao was not optimistic.\n\"This is not a problem that can be resolved in one year,\" Mao said.\nMany local governments would defy or skirt decisions by the central government to limit investment in certain industries to a few regions, he said.\nAbout one percent of China's estimated 100,000 state enterprises are hopelessly in debt and unattractive to investors looking for cheap companies to buy or to merge with.\nThe government has been dragging its feet on bankruptcies due to fears of mass unemployment and social unrest.\nHowever, the number of bankruptcies in China -- unheard of for almost four decades -- was expected to more than double to 5,200 this year, or more than the total of the previous six years put together.\n","60":"China said on Wednesday Japan was heading for confrontation with an election platform reiterating Tokyo's claim to disputed islands in the East China Sea but said it was not too late for Japan to stop its reckless gamble.\n\"Japan is turning a deaf ear to warnings and protests from China...and has embarked on the road to confrontation,\" the official China Daily said, commenting on the election platform of Japan's biggest political party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).\n\"It is still not too late for Japan to stop this reckless gamble,\" the newspaper said in a commentary. \"It is high time for Japan to take measures to stop the game for the sake of the world and its own future.\"\nThe LDP announced last week an election platform that reiterates Tokyo's claim to the East China Sea islands, which Tokyo calls the Senkakus and which Beijing and Taipei call the Diaoyus.\n\"Japan has not learnt the lesson of its militarist expansion and...it is going into another dangerous game,\" the newspaper said.\nOn Monday, about 300 Taiwanese and Hong Kong protesters aboard a 50-boat flotilla pierced a Japanese maritime cordon around the islands and briefly raised the flags of Beijing and Taipei on the rocky outcrops in a challenge to Tokyo's claim of sovereignty.\nJapan has sought to calm passions in the dispute and asked China and Japan to prevent a recurrence of Monday's landings. Tokyo has said it would not recognise a lighthouse built on one of the islands by Japanese rightwingers this year.\nJapanese rightwingers sailed to the islands in July and repaired the lighthouse, rekindling the dispute.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang on Tuesday accused Japan of taking an irresponsibile approach by encouraging landings on the islands by the rightwing groups.\nShen warned that the will of the Chinese people \"cannot be bullied\" and that sovereignty ranked above everything else.\nThe row was aggravated last week when a Hong Kong activist drowned after diving into stormy seas near the islands as part of a protest against Tokyo's sovereignty claim.\nTokyo's claim dates back to 1895, when it defeated imperial China and seized the uninhabited islands. Japan says the issue is not open for discussion.\nChina has claimed sovereignty over the islands for centuries.\nTaiwan has no diplomatic ties with Japan, which only recognises Beijing's Communist government.\nThe China Daily commentary also slammed the LDP's election platform for containing an endorsement of visits by cabinet ministers to a Tokyo shrine to Japan's war dead.\n\"Japanese politicians have waged a war to reverse the verdict on Japan's war shame concluded by the world half a century ago,\" the commentary said.\nJapanese prime minister and LDP leader Ryutaro Hashimoto in July broke a decade-long taboo on prime ministerial visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, saying it was time for Japan to stop apologising for honouring its fallen soldiers.\n\"Such dishonest activities, which reinvigorate militarism, have naturally caused indignation in the war-victimised countries,\" the newspaper commentary said in reference to visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders.\nLast week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang expressed strong indignation over the LDP's election platform.\n","61":"Residents of a town in China's restive northwestern Xinjiang returned to work on Wednesday from the Lunar New Year holiday with officials vowing to deal a blow to separatism after a riot that left 10 people dead.\n\"The mayor...warned everyone to heighten their vigilance,\" Zhang Youlian, deputy director of the foreign affairs office of the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, said by telephone.\n\"We are resolved to deal a blow to the handful of ethnic separatist elements,\" Zhang told Reuters.\nPolice had arrested between 200 and 300 people in the crackdown following the riot, officials said.\nAbout 1,000 people from the Uighur ethnic minority rioted in the town of Yining in Yili prefecture last Wednesday in one of the largest and most violent demonstrations for independence in the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang for several years.\nParamilitary People's Armed Police only succeeded in dispersing the rioters, who smashed and burned cars and looted shops, a day later, a spokesman for the Xinjiang regional government said by telephone from Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital.\nThe riot left 10 people dead and 144 wounded, he said. All the victims were Han Chinese, another official said.\nThe death toll could rise, with up to seven people listed as missing, said one official in Yining.\nOf the wounded, 132 were civilians while the remaining 12 were members of the paramilitary armed police.\nLocal residents returned to work on Wednesday after the five-day Lunar New Year holidays, which ended on Tuesday, but an after-dark curfew remained in parts of the town and armed police still patrolled the streets, Zhang said.\n\"We resumed work today...Basically, it's normal,\" he said.\nAuthorities had sealed off the town, but planned to reopen the airport on Friday, Zhang said.\nLast week, demonstrators hurling rocks and bricks rampaged through the town, attacking Han Chinese on sight and setting fire to to about 20 vehicles.\nArmed police fired teargas to disperse the crowd.\nSeveral leaders of the riot had been arrested, the regional government spokesman said, adding that a manhunt for other rioters was under way.\nThe leader of an exiled nationalist Uighur group in Kazakhstan said hundreds of Uighurs had been arrested following the riot.\nYusupbek Mukhlisi, leader of the Almaty-based United National Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan, said the riot was sparked by the execution of 30 Uighurs by Chinese authorities last week.\nZhang dismissed the report as a rumour.\nYining is 50 km (30 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan, where many exiled Uighur separatists live.\nThe riot was among the most violent for many years in Xinjiang, where Turkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority and ethnic Han Chinese make up 38 percent of the population.\nXinjiang authorities last year stepped up a crackdown on separatists and underground religious activity after clashes, bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.\nLast May, Beijing ordered tighter controls along Xinjiang's lengthy border to block the smuggling of weapons and subversive materials from nearby central Asian states.\n","62":"China announced on Saturday a massive restructuring of one of its biggest conglomerates after reportedly meting out a suspended death sentence to the son of the former company chairman, one of the country's ruling elite.\nState media announced the restructuring of Capital Iron, or Shougang, on Saturday but made no mention of the suspended death sentence handed down to Zhou Beifang, the former head of two of the steel giant's Hong Kong-listed affiliates.\nA Beijing court gave Zhou the suspended death sentence for corruption as part of China's highly-publicised anti-graft campaign launched last year, a Chinese source said on Saturday.\nThe sentence was the heaviest handed down in recent years to one of China's so-called \"princelings\", the popular sobriquet applied to the children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence.\nShougang, one of China's biggest conglomerates, was thrust into the limelight after Zhou's detention in February 1995.\nThe arrest of a man symbolising Beijing's efforts to wield capitalist influence while retaining a socialist veneer underlined the vulnerability of that system to nepotism and abuse.\nZhou Beifang's father, Zhou Guanwu, 78, resigned as chairman and Communist Party secretary of Shougang in February 1995, citing old age following his son's detention.\nThe Zhous have close ties to the family of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\nLast month, prosecutors filed charges of corruption against 30 people, including Zhou Beifang and two former officials of the Beijing city government. No other details of the case were available.\nChinese courts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases. Suspended death sentences are often commuted to life imprisonment after two years.\nCourt officials could not be reached for comment on the sentencing.\nThe China Daily said the restructuring of Shougang draws a clear line between the property rights, responsibility and management of the parent company and subsidiary.\nIn the past, a large percentage of the parent company's profits went to branch companies, many of which are running in the red, the newspaper said.\nShougang's parent company would gradually cut off financial subsidies to subsidiaries which would be forced to sink or swim in the market economy as part of the restructuring programme.\n\"We will provide financial support for our subsidiaries for a few years, helping them in investment, finance and discharge of their debts based on an appraisal of their fixed assets,\" Bi Qun, Communist Party secretary of Shougang, told the newspaper.\n\"Once that is done the subsidiary companies will develop strategies to stop losing money and begin to make profits,\" Bi was quoted as saying.\nThe number of employees of the parent company would be gradually slashed to 58,000, or one-fourth of the group's total, the Xinhua news agency said. It gave no timetable.\nThe group's 27 subsidiaries would employ 176,000 people.\nThe group registered 1.653 billion yuan ($199 million) in pre-tax profits in the first 10 months of 1996, Xinhua said. It gave no comparative figures.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.\nCommunist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus that threatened the party.\n","63":"In imperial China, executions were carried out by skinning, quartering, chopping a man in half at the waist or even decapitating an entire clan.\nFrom January 1, 1997, the People's Republic of China adds lethal injection as a means of executing death row convicts. Currently, all executions are by firing squad.\nHowever, more modern means of execution do not necessarily mean waning enthusiasm for capital punishment.\n\"Crime is worsening...and the Communist Party is obsessed with security,\" a Chinese political scientist who spoke on condition of anonymity said.\n\"The party believes in using draconian laws against disorder,\" the political scientist said.\nWith a string of new laws in recent years and thousands of executions a year, the party is clearly not squeamish.\nThe National People's Congress, or parliament, is debating amendments to the Criminal Law to increase the number of crimes punishable by death, Chinese jurists said. The amendments are due to be passed by a full session of parliament in March.\nIn the face of soaring crime, China executed at least 1,000 people in just the first two months of its \"Strike Hard\" anti-crime crackdown launched last April, the London-based human rights watchdog Amnesty International said. Thousands more executions may have gone unreported.\nCrime, virtually eliminated in the years after the puritan communists swept to power in 1949, has staged a revival in the past two decades in the wake of liberal economic reforms. Capital punishment is one means China chooses to try to deter violence.\nRISING EXECUTIONS\nAmnesty International recorded 3,612 death sentences and 2,535 executions in China in 1995 compared with 2,496 death sentences and 1,791 executions in 1994. Some 300 people were executed in the United States between the re-introduction of the death penalty in 1977 and January, 1996.\n\"It's killing the chicken to frighten the monkey,\" one jurist said, quoting a Chinese proverb.\nAmnesty International said the figures were believed to fall far short of the actual number of death sentences and executions.\nJustice Ministry officials declined requests for an interview. Police declined to comment.\nChina does not publish statistics about the death penalty, saying these are a state secret.\nDespite criticism from groups such as Amnesty International, capital punishment seems to be in China to stay.\n\"It's impossible for China to abolish the death penalty in the next 20 years,\" Yu Quanyu, vice-president of the China Society for Human Rights Studies, said.\nThe introduction of lethal injection as a means of execution was contained in amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law that took effect on January 1.\nCurrently, capital punishment is carried out at execution grounds with a single bullet fired at close range into the heart or back of the head with the convict kneeling, his ankles manacled and hands tied behind his back.\nChinese and foreign jurists were divided over China's motives for introducing lethal injection and allowing executions to be staged inside prisons.\n\"I strongly suspect...they are making it even more convenient to harvest organs from executed prisoners for transplant purposes,\" Robin Munro of Human Rights Watch\/Asia said in a telephone interview from Hong Kong.\nMedical facilities can be set up inside prisons to harvest organs, Munro said.\nChinese dissidents living in exile have accused China of timing executions of death row convicts to coincide with the need for transplants of organs, often for sale.\nChina vehemently denies the charge.\nChinese jurists argued that the introduction of lethal injection and allowing executions behind prison walls were intended to curb waste of police manpower -- not to mention increasing logistical difficulties in finding shooting grounds.\nSUPERSTITIOUS VILLAGERS\n\"It is difficult to find execution grounds,\" another jurist said. \"Superstitious villagers protest against executions on their land.\"\nMany executions were held at military target ranges and along river banks, requiring huge police manpower to escort death row convicts and to stand guard to keep away curious onlookers.\nChinese laws do not specifically state the site of execution grounds.\nCurrently, death row convicts cannot be executed inside prisons because it is regarded as inhumane for other inmates to hear the sound of gunfire, jurists said.\nThe use of lethal injection would be quiet -- and save on manpower, they said.\nBut Chinese jurists were doubtful whether death row convicts would be given a choice between the bullet and lethal injection.\n","64":"A court in southwest China sentenced at least five dissidents to prison terms of up to 10 years for subversion, a human rights watchdog group said on Saturday.\nAt least eight other dissidents were rounded up in Guiyang, capital of Guizhou province, in the same case, the New York-based Human Rights in China said.\nAn unknown number of the eight were sentenced, the group said. Details were not available.\nThe Guiyang Intermediate People's Court sentenced the five dissidents in May, 1996, but Human Rights in China said it was not able to confirm their convictions until recently.\n\"There were many people involved. The place was remote...It took a lot of time to verify the facts,\" Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human Rights in China, told Reuters by telephone.\nThe convictions could not be indepenently confirmed. Court officials and police could not be reached for comment.\nTwo of the political activists, Lu Yongxiang and Huang Zhongmin, were arrested in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1995 -- the sixth anniversary of a bloody military crackdown on student-led demonstrations for democracy -- while distributing copies of a daring, open letter to Communist Party leaders, the group said.\nLu, 50, a veteran dissident, and Huang, 35, a businessman, were each sentenced to five years in prison for participating in a counter-revolutionary group, spreading counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement.\nChen Xi, 42, a lecturer-turned-businessman, received the harshest sentence -- 10 years in prison -- for organising and leading a counter-revolutionary group.\nThe open letter demanded the ruling Communist Party lift a decades-old ban on the establishment of new political parties and newspapers and draft a new constitution guaranteeing independence of the judiciary, democratic elections and freedom of the press.\nIn the letter, the dissidents threw their weight behind Zhao Ziyang, who was deposed as Communist Party chief in a power struggle that followed the 1989 crackdown.\nZhao is under virtual house arrest, sources close to him have said. He dropped from public view after May 19, 1989, when he visited students occupying Tiananmen Square and, with tears in his eyes, beseeched their leaders to end the protests. The next day hardliners clamped martial law on the Chinese capital.\nOn June 3 and 4, 1989 troops backed by tanks and firing automatic weapons stormed into the city, retaking the square and crushing the demonstrations with heavy loss of life.\nThe open letter also demanded the authorities release fellow dissidents, including former student leader Wang Dan, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison last year for conspiring to subvert the government.\nThe two other dissidents jailed by the Guiyang court were Liao Shuangyuan, 43, a legal adviser, and Zeng Ning, 28, a legal expert, who received four and two years in prison respectively for organising and joining a counter-revolutionary group.\nChina jailed dozens of dissidents in 1996 as part of a drive for stability that followed an easing of foreign pressure over its human rights record, diplomats and human rights activists say.\nBeijing regularly hits out at criticism of its human rights record, regarding it as interference in its internal affairs and saying its priority is to fulfill the rights of its 1.2 billion people to food and clothing.\n","65":"China on Tuesday introduced rules governing direct shipping links with Taiwan, ignoring a decades-old ban by the island it regards as a renegade province.\nThe regulations, which take effect from Tuesday, allow only wholly Chinese-owned or Taiwan-owned shipping companies or joint ventures involving Chinese or Taiwanese shipowners to sail between the two sides, Xinhua news agency said.\nHong Kong's Beijing-backed Wen Wei Po newspaper said the southeastern Chinese cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou would be the first ports to be opened to direct shipping links with Taiwan.\n\"The conditions for (establishing) direct shipping links are ripe,\" the newspaper said.\nTaiwan's Nationalist government has banned direct air and shipping links with China since 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops lost the Chinese civil war to the communists and fled to the island.\nWith tensions easing since the late 1980s, civilian aircraft and vessels have skirted the ban by stopping over in a third country or territory such as the British colony of Hong Kong or Portuguese-run Macau.  \nTaiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct transport links, but Taiwanese authorities have been reluctant to lift the ban.\nThe Nationalists, who say they are committed to reunification with China, see direct transport links as their last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.\nChina has threatened to invade if the island seeks independence.\nUnder the regulations, shipping companies must apply with the Chinese Ministry of Communications for permission to ply routes between the two sides. The rules made no mention of any need to seek approval from Taiwan authorities.\nThe ministry has 45 days to decide whether to allow a shipping company to sail between the two sides, according to the regulations.\nThe rules empower the ministry to warn and seize the unlawful income of shipping companies breaking the rules.\nChina has poured cold water on a proposal by Taipei to turn Taiwan's Kaohsiung into an extraterritorial port, allowing third party ships to ply routes between the two sides.  \nThe Taipei-based Economic Daily News said on Tuesday Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui had urged the central bank to study how to control capital outflows to China in a further bid to limit the island's economic exposure on its main rival's turf. The central bank denied the report.\nSpeculation that Taipei might change its China policy has mounted since Lee cautioned last week that the island's economy needed to avoid over-dependence on the mainland.\n\"The Chinese are not really making much progress on other fronts... They have decided to focus on the three links and apply pressure on the Taiwanese,\" a Western diplomat in Beijing said. The three links refer to trade, transport and mail.\nOn the diplomatic front, the rivalry has intensified, analysts say, with China trying hard to isolate the island and limit its contacts with other states.\nTaiwan state-funded television said Vice-President Lien Chan was visiting the former Soviet republic of Ukraine,  which formally recognises Beijing. The Ukraine has denied the report.\nChina announced a diplomatic coup on Monday, persuading the West African nation of Niger to switch recognition to Beijing.\n","66":"Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan is to step down in a long-delayed reshuffle after the downfall of his mentor, the Chinese capital's disgraced Communist Party boss Chen Xitong, sources with close ties to the city government said on Sunday.\nLi, 58, mayor of Beijing since 1993, would become a vice-minister of labour and could eventually replace Li Boyong, 62, as labour minister, said the sources who asked not to be identified. The two Lis are not related.\nLi Qiyan's departure was widely expected after one of his vice-mayors came under investigation for economic crimes and committed suicide in April 1995.\nThe suicide shocked the nation and led to the downfall of Li's mentor, Chen Xitong, who has since disappeared from the public eye.\nChen resigned as Beijing's Communist Party boss and was later sacked from the Politburo, becoming the most senior official to be ensnared in a corruption scandal since the communists came to power in 1949.\nOfficials say Chen was himself still under investigation for possible wrongdoing.\nThe city government had been virtually paralysed since Chen's disgrace, the sources said.\n\"After Chen Xitong stepped down, the (city) government lost its credibility ... and could maintain only the most basic operation,\" one source told Reuters. \"It could not embark on huge projects ... It could not do anything.\"\nLi would be replaced by Jia Qinglin, 56, party secretary of the southeastern province of Fujian, the sources said.\nJia arrived in Beijing last week to take up his new post as acting mayor, the sources said. Jia is expected to formally become the capital's mayor after his nomination is approved by the Beijing People's Congress.\nIn the run-up to the party's 15th congress next year, Jia could be promoted to Beijing's Communist Party secretary and land a seat in the party's powerful Politburo, they said.\nThe vice-mayor who committed suicide was found to have used his position to amass 116 houses illegally and build himself a villa on the outskirts of the city. He also masterminded a $37 million embezzlement and graft scam, officials have said.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.\nCommunist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus which threatened the party. Courts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases.\nEarlier this month, prosecutors filed charges of corruption against 30 people, including Zhou Beifang, former head of two publicly listed Hong Kong affiliates of a China steel giant, and two former officials of the Beijing city government.\nThe announcement of the charges against Zhou was among the first against one of China's so-called \"princelings\", the popular sobriquet applied to the children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence.\nZhou, detained in February, 1995, is the son of Zhou Guanwu, former chairman and Communist Party secretary of Beijing's giant Capital Iron and Steel Corporation, also known as Shougang, and among the largest conglomerates in China.\n","67":"Beijing's propaganda machine has accused the United States of using Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, as a tool to Westernise and break up China.\n\"Western countries, led by the United States, have directed the focal point of their 'Westernisation' and 'disintegration' (campaign) at China,\" the Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\"(They) have made the Dalai Lama clique their tool to implement this anti-Chinese strategy,\" the newspaper said, noting that the West had showered awards on the Dalai Lama, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\nChina has rarely singled out a country for backing the Dalai Lama, one Chinese analyst said.\nSino-U.S. relations have been strained in recent years by disputes over Tibet as well as Beijing's diplomatic rival Taiwan, human rights abuses and widespread copyright piracy in China.\nChina blames followers of the Dalai Lama for periodic unrest in the Himalayan region bordering India.\nThe Dalai Lama says says he wants autonomy and freedom of worship in his deeply Buddhist homeland. He fled China into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule.\nThe December 30 edition of the Tibet Daily slammed Western criticism of China's human rights record in the region, saying critics \"confused black with white\".\n\"Sovereign rights are much more important than human rights,\" the newspaper said, quoting 92-year-old paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\n\"The sovereignty and security of the state should be placed first,\" it said.\nThe newspaper argued that communist rule protected the rights of the majority of Tibetans by ending slavery and raising living standards.\nTibet has been rocked in recent years by sporadic, sometimes violent, anti-Chinese unrest with monks and nuns often at the forefront of demonstrations for independence.\nChinese authorities have offered a reward of one million yuan ($120,000) for the arrest of those responsible for a bomb set off on Christmas Day outside government offices in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.\nNo casualties were reported, but the bomb caused widespread damage, shattering windows 100 metres (yards) away, officials have said.\nChinese officials have said there was little doubt the blast was politically motivated and carried out by followers of the the Dalai Lama.\nLast week, Tibet's government-in-exile in Dharamsala, in northern India, denied the Chinese allegation, saying the bombing could have been carried out by China as an excuse to crack down on dissent.\nChinese authorities have tightened security across Tibet in the run-up to New Year celebrations next month and vowed to continue a campaign to indoctrinate monks and nuns to be \"patriotic\" and to pledge allegiance to the Chinese government.\n","68":"China has pledged to edge open its insurance, stock, retail, wholesale and banking sectors to foreign investment as part of a drive for long-delayed entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO).\n\"From 1997-2000, China is expected to open its insurance and stock market wider to foreign investment,\" the China Daily said on Sunday, quoting Ma Jixian, an official of the State Economic and Trade Commission under the cabinet.\nThe pledge was contained in a unilateral action plan submitted by China to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the Philippines last month, the newspaper said.\nBefore the end of the decade, foreign insurers would have access to markets outside Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, Ma said without elaborating.\nChina's insurance market was once virtually monopolised by the state-owned People's Insurance Group but the sector has gradually opened up to domestic as well as foreign competition.\nOnly three foreign insurers are able to write insurance policies in China, including American International Assurance Co Ltd, a part of the American International Group Inc.\nThe others are Japan's Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co Ltd and which has a life insurance joint venture with a domestic insurer.\nMa, one of China's representatives at the APEC summit, said foreign stock companies would be allowed to handle A shares, whose availability is still confined to native Chinese. He gave no further details.\nCurrently, foreign investors are restricted to buying B shares, while Chinese nationals can only buy A shares.\nIn its action plan, China also pledged to cut its average import tariffs to about 15 percent from the current 23 percent.\nThe tariffs would be reduced futher in subsequent years, Ma said without going into details.\n\"A majority of non-tariff measures will have been abolished by 2010 and all those incompatible with World Trade Organisation rules will have been erased by 2020,\" Ma said.\nChina has pushed to gain entry to the WTO on the favourable terms of a developing nation, but Western countries, particularly the United States, have insisted its economy is too big for such preferential treatment.\nAccording to the action plan, China would allow foreign banks to open more operational outfits in 24 Chinese cities and launch pilot bases where foreign banks can conduct yuan business, the newspaper said.\nIn the first decade of the next century, foreign banks would be allowed to expand their presence beyond the current 24 pilot cities and more pilot bases would be available for them to conduct yuan business, it said.\nChina would let overseas retailers establish more joint venture or cooperative retailing chains in areas beyond the 11 pilot cities currently allowed, the newspaper said.\nThe liberalisation would cover all provincial capitals and major economic cities by the year 2010, the newspaper said, adding that foreign retailers would be free to open outlets in China by 2020.\nForeign investors would be allowed larger stakes in China's power sector and have greater access to China's river, marine and road transportation if Beijing becomes a member of the WTO, it said.\nChina would further open its tourism sector, allowing joint venture travel agencies in five cities on an experimental basis over the next three years, the newspaper said.\n","69":"Beijing has pledged to open its doors ajar to imports of U.S. textiles under a new deal, but Washington has no illusions it can close its yawning textile trade gap with China, diplomats said on Monday.\nChinese and U.S. negotiators signed a new textile agreement in Beijing on Sunday in an 11th-hour deal that ended the threat of a cross-Pacific trade war and ensured U.S. access to China's textile markets.\n\"It (the deal) provides us with an opportunity to increase our access to China's markets in high-priority areas,\" one diplomat said. He declined to elaborate.\n\"(But) we are under no illusions that we are going to balance textiles as a single sector of our trade,\" a second diplomat said on condition of anonymity.\nChina exported $6.5 billion worth of textiles to the United States in 1995 but imported only $64 million. Diplomats attributed the sluggish U.S. textile exports to Beijing's high tariff rates and non-tariff barriers.\n\"Textiles are never going to be balanced but it's important that there be a market access element there,\" the second diplomat said.\nThe agreement gave China a U.S. import quota slightly larger than the previous 1994 textile pact, and China pledged to reduce its tariffs on textile imports.\nBoth the Chinese and U.S. sides declined to say by how much U.S. textile exports to China would increase and vice versa, or by how much China's tariffs would be cut.\n\"There are significant gains for U.S. industries,\" a third diplomat said.\n\"It was, for the first time, a concessionary admission on (the) part of the Chinese that they too had to do something with regard to supplying market access for U.S. products where we were competitive,\" he said but did not go into details.\nThe overall U.S. trade deficit with China -- the United States' largest after its deficit with Japan -- was seen reaching $38 billion in 1996, up from $34 billion in 1995, according to U.S. figures.\nThe new textile agreement may be good news for U.S. textile manufacturers and exporters, but it could be bad news for China's lumbering state enterprises.\nA flood of U.S. textile imports could intensify competition and further cripple many of China's state enterprises, almost half of which are in the red, analysts said.\n\"U.S. textile imports will intensify competition in the already saturated domestic textile market,\" a Chinese economist said.\n\"Life will be even more difficult for a group of loss-making textile enterprises,\" said the economist, who asked not to be identified. \"Some enterprises will be forced to bow out of the textile industry -- declare bankruptcy or merge.\"\nState-owned textile factories in Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, registered losses of 350 million yuan ($42.2 million) in the first seven months of 1996, the China Business Times said on Monday.\nThe accord ended the threat of a Sino-U.S. trade war, which had loomed after Washington slapped $19 million in penalties on Chinese imports last September, accusing Beijing of shipping textiles through third countries to evade U.S. restrictions on Chinese imports.\nChina had threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but delayed the action to allow time for further talks.\nBeijing announced after Sunday's deal that it was calling off its retaliatory measures, but Washington's penalties remained in force.\n","70":"Chinese dissident Wang Dan has appealed against his 11-year jail sentence for plotting to subvert the government, but his mother said on Tuesday she held little hope of an acquittal or a lighter sentence.\nWang Lingyun said she hoped U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and German President Roman Herzog would raise her son's predicament in their meetings with Chinese leaders when they visit China later this month.\n\"Wang Dan... should be acquitted because... he's innocent,\" she told Reuters by telephone. \"We hope for an acquittal or a reduced sentence... but it is unlikely.\"\nWang Lingyun, who acted as one of two defence lawyers in her son's case, said court officials had asked her to submit a written defence for the appeal and that family members may not be allowed to attend the appeals court trial.\nExperts on China's legal system have said the chances of the appeals court overturning the lower court's verdict were slim.\nAn official of the Beijing Higher People's Court said the 27-year-old dissident had filed his appeal. She declined to provide further details.\nThe Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court took less than four hours last Wednesday to convict and sentence Wang, who had already served four years in prison for his role as a leader of the 1989 student demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the military with heavy loss of life.\nOn Monday, visiting Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said he had expressed his disapproval to Chinese Premier Li Peng over the jailing of Wang.\nA foreign ministry spokesman defended China at a news briefing on Tuesday, saying Beijing would not impose its laws on others and that foreign countries should take a similar stance.\nThe spokesman also said China opposed using human rights as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of any country.\nAn international human rights group denounced what it said was the \"secret trial\" of Wang on a trumped-up charge.\n\"What (the court) brought to bear on Wang Dan was a secret trial in which the facts were deliberately hidden and the truth distorted,\" the New York-based Human Rights in China said in a statement made available to Reuters by facsimile.\n\"A fabricated charge was used to wantonly convict Wang Dan,\" the group said. \"Wang Dan's case... is suppression and persecution of thought and speech by the Chinese government.\"\nWhen told during the trial of his right to seek the removal of any biased judges, Wang demanded all judges and prosecutors be removed from the case. The tribunal rejected his request after a few minutes of deliberation, the group said.\nChina said it was an open and fair trial but Human Rights in China said no foreign reporters, diplomats or other international observers were allowed to attend.\nThe group said more than 10 people wearing tags identifying themselves as reporters attended the trial but there was no mention of the conviction in the local Chinese-language media.\nThe jailing of Wang was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China's struggling pro-democracy movement. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps.\nHuman Rights in China accused the official Xinhua news agency of preparing English-language stories about the results of the trial and an interview with the chief judge even before the verdict was delivered.\nAsked to comment, an official of the foreign affairs office of Xinhua said: \"It is not necessary to find out whether the story was prepared before or after the sentencing... News agencies have different ways and practices of releasing news.\"\nAfter breaking the news of Wang's conviction, it took Xinhua only 1-1\/2 hours to put out a 54-paragraph story on the interview with the chief judge.\n","71":"China's leadership has dissolved the once-powerful personal office of 92-year-old patriarch Deng Xiaoping in what could be a sign his health is increasingly fragile, a Chinese source and diplomats said on Wednesday.\nDeng's health has stirred intense speculation this week, rocking stock markets in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan on Tuesday and prompting an attempt by Beijing to calm fears.\nJapanese media reported that Deng had been admitted to hospital in critical condition, while a Hong Kong newspaper said he was recuperating at home from a brain haemorrhage but was not near death.\nChina's official media on Wednesday made no mention of Deng's health.\nThe Deng office of advisers and secretaries -- or \"Deng ban\" as it is known in Chinese -- was dissolved shortly before the Lunar New Year, which fell on February 7, a Chinese source with close ties to the Communist Party said.\n\"If true, it is a signal Deng's health had deteriorated... Deng can no longer sustain a very active role in the political sphere,\" said a Western diplomat who had heard about the disbanding of the office.\nChinese sources told Reuters on Monday that Communist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng cut short out-of-town trips last weekend to return to Beijing to visit the ailing patriarch.\nDeng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival, when he appeared frail and faltering.\nThe dissolution of the Deng office also signalled China's succession problem was virtually complete and that Jiang had further consolidated power.\n\"Jiang Zemin is eager to tell the world that he is now in charge... and he no longer needs to take directives from Deng's office,\" the Chinese source said.\nThe office used to issue directives to the current leadership, including Jiang, but was considered to have outlived its usefulness, the source said.\nIt had been headed by Deng's top aide, General Wang Ruilin, a member of the party's powerful Central Military Commission.\n\"Deng Xiaoping has been retired for many years... Deng's office has no direct function,\" the source said.\nDeng, whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, retired from his last official position in 1990 and his only post now is honorary chairman of China's Bridge Association, a title that reflects his lifelong passion for the game.\nRumours about Deng's health surface periodically and often have a direct impact on China-related bourses, where Deng's demise is seen by some as a potentially destabilising factor.\nApparently trying to calm China's markets, newspapers splashed a report that economic tsar Zhu Rongji held a seminar on Deng's economic theories and reported Deng had sent his condolences for the funeral of a late defence minister.\nThe Japanese daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun, quoting diplomatic sources in Beijing with close ties to senior military officials, said Deng was critically ill after a brain haemorrhage.\nThe Chinese leadership had told senior party and government officials not to leave the country unless obliged to do so for pressing diplomatic reasons, the newspaper said.\nJapan's Kyodo news agency said Deng suffered a brain haemorrhage last Friday.\nHong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper said Deng was recuperating at home and \"was not about to die soon\".\nOn Tuesday, China played down fears that Deng's health was deteriorating, saying there had been \"no big change\". It declined to say if there had been a small change or what could count as a major change.\n","72":"China has pledged to open its insurance, stock, retail, wholesale and banking sectors to foreign investment as part of a drive for long-delayed entry to the World Trade Organisation.\n\"From 1997-2000, China is expected to open its insurance and stock market wider to foreign investment,\" the China Daily said Sunday, quoting Ma Jixian, an official of the State Economic and Trade Commission under the cabinet.\nThe pledge was contained in a unilateral action plan submitted by China to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the Philippines last month, the newspaper said.\nBefore the end of the decade, foreign insurers would have access to markets outside Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, Ma said without elaborating.\nChina's insurance market was once virtually monopolised by the state-owned People's Insurance Group but the sector has gradually opened up to domestic as well as foreign competition.\nOnly three foreign insurers are able to write insurance policies in China, including American International Assurance Co. Ltd, a part of the American International Group Inc.\nThe others are Japan's Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd and which has a life insurance joint venture with a domestic insurer.\nMa, one of China's representatives at the APEC summit, said foreign stock companies would be allowed to handle A shares, whose availability is still confined to native Chinese. He gave no further details.\nCurrently, foreign investors are restricted to buying B shares, while Chinese nationals can only buy A shares.\nIn its action plan, China also pledged to cut its average import tariffs to about 15 percent from the current 23 percent.\nThe tariffs would be reduced futher in subsequent years, Ma said without going into details.\n\"A majority of non-tariff measures will have been abolished by 2010 and all those incompatible with World Trade Organisation rules will have been erased by 2020,\" Ma said.\nChina has pushed to gain entry to the WTO on the favourable terms of a developing nation, but Western countries, particularly the United States, have insisted its economy is too big for such preferential treatment.\nAccording to the action plan, China would allow foreign banks to open more operational outfits in 24 Chinese cities and launch pilot bases where foreign banks can conduct yuan business, the newspaper said.\nIn the first decade of the next century, foreign banks would be allowed to expand their presence beyond the current 24 pilot cities and more pilot bases would be available for them to conduct yuan business, it said.\nChina would let overseas retailers establish more joint venture or cooperative retailing chains in areas beyond the 11 pilot cities currently allowed, the newspaper said.\nThe liberalisation would cover all provincial capitals and major economic cities by the year 2010, the newspaper said, adding that foreign retailers would be free to open outlets in China by 2020.\nForeign investors would be allowed larger stakes in China's power sector and have greater access to China's river, marine and road transportation if Beijing becomes a member of the WTO, it said.\nChina would further open its tourism sector, allowing joint venture travel agencies in five cities on an experimental basis over the next three years, the newspaper said.\n","73":"Two Chinese magazines are struggling for survival after being targeted in a crusade by China's propaganda tsars to cleanse the media of liberal influences, Chinese sources said.\n\"Focus\" magazine in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen has suspended publication for two issues after a Hong Kong newspaper reported the magazine defied propaganda tsars and ran a cover story on the anniversary of the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, the sources said.\nThe Propaganda Department of the Communist Party had frowned on any commemoration of the decade of turmoil unleashed by revolutionary leader Mao Zedong to purge political rivals and infuse the nation with renewed ideological vigour.\nA writer for the magazine said the suspension was due to a Hong Kong newspaper report of the article's publication.\n\"Had it not been for the foreign report, the magazine would not have suffered this kind of setback,\" said the writers, peaking anonymously \"This was a kind of punishment...by the party.\"\nIn a telephone interview, Li Mei, publisher of Focus, disputed this assessment, saying the suspension was linked to unrelated financial trouble.\nOther Chinese sources said the problems at \"Focus\" stemmed from the Communist Party's clampdown on publications and authors who dare to break away from a stultifying diet of state-approved fare.\n\"If a publication takes a detour (from the party line), it will be suspended for restructuring. There will be no exceptions,\" one source quoted propaganda tsars as saying.\nPropaganda tsars are also debating the fate of the Beijing-based magazine \"Orient\" for publishing a series of book reviews on the \"Collected Works of Gu Zhun\", sources said.\nThe Propaganda Department of the ruling Communist Party had ordered a gag on all debate on the thoughts of Gu, an independent thinker who angered Beijing before his death during the Cultural Revolution.\nGu openly opposed totalitarianism and supported the rule of law and civil rights.\nThe fifth edition of the magazine was published in September under the watchful eyes of censors, the sources said.\n\"We will still be able to publish the sixth edition. After that we don't know,\" a magazine editor, who asked not to be named, said in an interview.\n\"They did not say what exactly the problem was with the magazine,\" said the editor who suggested that politics could be the cause.\nThe axe has fallen on other publications, authors and filmmakers.\nIn August, the Press and Publications Administration suspended publication of the Economic Work Monthly, based in the southwestern province of Guizhou.\nThe suspension followed the magazine's publication of an article critical of a privately circulated tract known as the \"10,000-word essay\" that urges a return to class struggle and warns of the erosion of the state sector by private enterprise.\nIn September, Cui Enqing was sacked as president of the Beijing Youth Daily after the Chinese capital's most outspoken newspaper reported a poisoning case that caused a plunge in sales of a state-owned beverage manufacturer.\nPropaganda tsars also have banned all of the novels and two films of controversial writer Wang Shuo.\nThe campaign to enforce ideological orthodoxy has left Chinese filmmakers at a loss as to what kind of movies would receive the blessings of propaganda tsars. The number of movies made this year has fallen sharply compared with previous years.\n","74":"Most Chinese have been slow to forgive and forget Japanese atrocities in World War Two and fear a possible resurgence of militarism in the land of the rising sun, a survey published in Beijing on Saturday showed.\nThe survey, conducted by the official China Youth Daily last December, showed that 99.4 percent of 15,000 people interviewed nationwide thought young Chinese \"should remember\" Japan's 1931-45 occupation of China.\nMore than 97 percent of the respondents were aged below 40, too young to have been victims of Japan's war atrocities. By Beijing's count, 35 million Chinese were killed or wounded by invading Japanese troops.\nAsked what first came to their minds when Japan was mentioned, 81.3 percent of respondents said the Rape of Nanjing.\nJapanese troops marched into Nanjing, China's pre-communist capital and known then as Nanking, in 1937 and engaged in an orgy of rape and massacre. Up to 250,000 Chinese were believed to have been killed.\nMore than 97 percent of respondents said they could not tolerate repeated attempts by Japanese officials to whitewash their wartime atrocities, including the Rape of Nanjing.\nThe China Youth Daily survey showed that 94.9 percent of the respondents were opposed to Japan becoming a United Nations Security Council member.\nIt also showed that 85.1 percent of respondents believed Japan wanted to become a military superpower and 70.7 percent saw Japan as a new threat to peace in Asia.\nChina itself ruffled feathers in the region last March when it intimidated rival Taiwan by conducting missile tests and war games close to the island in the run-up to Taiwan's historic presidential elections.\nThe sheer size of the People's Liberation Army -- the world's biggest at three million -- has caused uneasiness among China's neighbours.\nChina has been mired in a dispute with Japan over a group of islands in the East China Sea and another dispute with Asian neighbours over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.\nThe survey showed that 53.8 percent of respondents thought that Japanese despised Chinese, while 50.8 percent said Japanese discriminated against Chinese.\nMany Chinese themselves harbour deep suspicions and are hostile toward foreigners.\nMore than 56 percent of the respondents said the Japanese were \"cruel\", 45.2 percent said \"arrogant\" and 45.3 percent described them as \"war freaks\" by nature.\nBut 52.7 percent of the respondents said they owned Japanese-made electrical appliances.\nMany respondents were suspicious of Japanese motives for investing in China. More than half said Japanese investment aimed to control China, while 45.3 percent said Japan dumped outdated equipment in China.\nOn Friday, the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, accused the United States and Japan of covering up the U.S. military's firing of uranium-tipped bullets near Okinawa during drills in December 1995 and January 1996.\nThe United States apologised this month.\nThe People's Daily said Washington's argument that the bullets were mislabelled was unconvincing and questioned why the incident was kept a secret for more than a year.\n","75":"China warned Britain on Tuesday against challenging it in the World Court over its decision to disband Hong Kong's elected legislature when it takes back the territory in mid-1997.\n\"If Britain does this, this will damage Sino-British relations,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a regular news briefing.\n\"If the British act wilfully, create troubles and do not cooperate with the Chinese side, then Sino-British relations will be damaged,\" Shen said when asked about Britain's threat.\nLast week, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind denounced China's plans to disband the democratically elected legislature and proposed letting the International Court of Justice in the Hague rule on the dispute.\nAfter more than 150 years of British rule, the capitalist territory of 6.3 million people falls back under the Chinese flag at midnight on June 30, 1997, with promises from Beijing's communist leadership that almost nothing will change.\nUpon the handover of Hong Kong, a Beijing-appointed provisional legislature will take over from the elected Legislative Council, reversing democratic reforms introduced by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten over the past four years.\nPatten has lashed out at the creation of the post-colonial legislature, calling its appointment by the 400-member Beijing-backed Selection Committee last week \"a bizarre farce\" and a \"stomach-churning\" process.\nHe has said the provisional legislature would be a \"rubber stamp\" chamber that would simply echo Beijing.\nSpokesman Shen said matters pertaining to Hong Kong would be China's internal affairs after July 1, 1997 and warned Britain against interference.\n\"This will interfere in China's internal affairs,\" Shen said of Britain's threat. \"Playing the international card is useless.\"\n\"To cooperate with China is of benefit to Britain, otherwise it will not be beneficial,\" he said.\nHong Kong's first post-colonial chief executive, 59-year-old shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, has defended China's controversial decision and lashed at Britain, saying the territory's colonial masters must \"face the reality\".\nTung has said it was irresponsible of Britain to threaten to take Beijing to the World Court over the interim chamber.\nThe controversial new body is dominated by pro-Beijing figures -- including 33 incumbent lawmakers and many politicians who lost to pro-democracy forces in the 1995 Legislative Council election, the first time all seats were filled by vote, either direct or indirect.\nThe Democratic Party, the favourite in last year's election with 19 of the 60 council seats, boycotted moves to create the provisional body, branding it anti-democratic.\nThe Provisional Legislative Council, as it will be known, is to sit from July 1 until a new legislature can be constituted by elections, set for 1998.\n","76":"North Korea said on Monday it would fire a top official marooned in South Koreas embassy in China if he sought asylum and Seoul went on alert for possible attack but said it wanted talks on the Cold War crisis.\nPyongyangs Foreign Ministry, commenting on the highest level defection yet from the Stalinist nation, saying that if leading ideologue Hwang Jang-yop had been kidnapped, then North Korea would take \"decisive countermeasures\".\n\"Our stand is simple and clear. If he was kidnapped, we cannot tolerate it and we will take decisive countermeasures,\" the KCNA news agency, monitored in Tokyo, quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying.\n\"If he sought asylum, it means that he is a renegade and he is dismissed,\" it said, adding that it had asked Beijing to investigate what it called the disappearance of Hwang, who took refuge in Seouls mission in Beijing six days ago.\nNorth Koreas ambassador was believed to have met officials at Chinas Foreign Ministry on Monday.\nHwangs defection has embarrassed his hermit homeland, delighted Seoul and mired Beijing in a quandary over how to usher him out of China without offending an old communist comrade or a new capitalist friend.\nBut Hwang turned 74 on Monday with no sign of progress to celebrate in his appeal for asylum in the South, and still stranded in Seouls heavily guarded consulate in Beijing.\nU.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright voiced U.S. concern over events on the Korean peninsula, saying they underlined the need for dialogue between rival North and South.\nSouth Korea prepared for possible attacks by Pyongyang as the Cold War crisis escalated, but said confrontation over the defector would not scuttle its efforts for detente.\nAnother prominent defector, Li Il-nam, a nephew of North Korean leader Kim Jong-ils ex-wife, remained in a coma after being shot and critically wounded at the weekend by suspected North Korean agents near Seoul.\nSecurity around South Koreas ports, airports and other public places had been beefed up and 10,000 police and soldiers searched for the two suspected agents who shot Li.\nSeoul Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said problems stemming from Hwangs defection were just the start of headaches for Seoul because of a crisis in the North.\n\"I believe the North Korean regimes crisis will deepen as time passes because theres no likelihood of improvement in its economic hardship and food shortages, and signs of laxity in its social order,\" Yoo told a meeting of South Korean diplomats.\nSouth Koreas security-related ministers on Sunday agreed that a desperate Pyongyang resort to guerrilla attacks after Hwang, a top adviser the Norths Kim Jong-il, sought asylum.\nDour warnings from North Korean officials in Beijing of the consequences of any attempt to move Hwang to the South gave a hint of Pyongyangs willingness to retaliate.\n\"If they make him go to Seoul, I think there will be war,\" said one North Korean official who declined to be identified.\nSouth Korean diplomats and Chinese police guarding the mission brought in extra blankets and mattresses in a sign they expected a lengthy stand-off over Hwang.\nHowever, dozens of North Korean officials disappeared on Monday afternoon from outside the building where they have kept a round-the-clock vigil since Hwang disappeared inside.\nChina, an unwilling third party in the feuding between the two hostile ends of the Korean peninsula, has appealed to both sides to act calmly to resolve the affair.\nAnalysts say the North has suffered huge loss of face over the defection of Hwang, who was ranked high in the hierarchy of his Stalinist homeland and was the architect of its governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance.\n","77":"China's former first lady Wang Guangmei auctioned her private antique collection on Tuesday and said she would use proceeds to help impoverished mothers.\nWang's collection, consisting of porcelain bowls and plates and a brush holder made of ivory dating back to the Qing (1644-1911) and Song (960-1279) dynasties, fetched 566,000 yuan ($68,000) at an auction at a Beijing hotel.\n\"My mother gave them to me ... They are priceless to me,\" Wang told Reuters.\nShe is the widow of former president Liu Shaoqi who died in prison during the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.\nThe Sungari auction house had put the value of the antiques, some of which were Wang's dowry from her wealthy capitalist father, at up to 510,000 yuan ($61,000).\nThe collection was seized from Wang and eluded destruction by radical Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. The authorities returned some of her collection when she was released from prison 11 years later.\n\"They were at Zhongnanhai or they would have all been smashed during the Cultural Revolution,\" Wang said. The Zhongnanhai compound in central Beijing still serves as home and office to many of China's leaders.\nLiu, China's former president, was deposed during the Cultural Revolution and died in prison in 1969. He was rehabilitated posthumously in 1980.\nWang said she had deep emotional ties to the collection but these were outweighed by concerns for those living in poverty.\n\"I would be reluctant to part with what my mother left me without a reason ... (but) my heart aches even more when I see impoverished mothers,\" the former first lady said.\n\"It shouldn't be like this. The country led by our Communist Party cannot let families be this destitute,\" she said.\nChina has about 65 million people still struggling to get by with incomes under the official absolute poverty line of 530 yuan ($64) a year, officials say.\nIn September, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin vowed to \"gnaw the hard bone\" of poverty by pouring funds into the drive to raise living standards for the poorest segment of the nation by the turn of the century.\nThe communists, who swept to power in 1949 on public resentment against widespread poverty and corruption, fear the widening gap between rich and poor today could spark social unrest and undermine its grip on power.\nChina says it reduced the number of people living in abject poverty by five million in 1995.\nAbout 3,500 destitute mothers in western and southwestern China were expected to benefit from Tuesday's auction.\nProceeds would go to an anti-poverty fund headed by the former first lady to lend money to impoverished mothers to help them get started in farming, raise livestock or make handicrafts to earn a living in future, Wang said.\nThe fund would also provide education and give medical treatment to destitute mothers, she said.\n","78":"China's flamboyant tycoon Mou Qizhong is hounded by creditors, faces lawsuits and investigation for alleged irregularities and cannot leave the country, company officials said.\nThe embattled chairman of the Land Economic Group, who has been identified by local media as China's second richest man, was down but not out and was counting on Russian-made satellites to bail him out of financial trouble, they said.\n\"We're in a crisis,\" Chen Fang, spokeswoman for Mou, told Reuters late on Monday. Mou declined repeated requests for an interview.\nDomestic creditors had demanded repayment of loans, group officials said. Mou's Land Economic Group owes 200 million yuan ($24.1 million) at home and another 200 million yuan in Hong Kong and Russia.\n\"Some creditors...have asked for their money back even before the maturity date,\" Chen said, adding that the company was planning to repay the loans gradually.\nDomestic banks had refused to grant Mou new loans and the group had given up seeking loans from Chinese banks. \"Abruptly recalling loans could be fatal,\" Chen said in an interview.\nAt least one investor had demanded its money back, but agreed to convert its equity into a loan, company officials said.\n\"The major problem we're facing now is circulating funds getting cut off... As a result, many projects are held up,\" Chen said.\nGovernment authorities had cleared Mou of suspicion of tax evasion and of using unlawful funds but he remained under investigation for other unspecified irregularities, company officials said.\nThe authorities had been dragging their feet on renewing his passport apparently out of fear that he may flee the country and join his wife and three sons in the United States. Mou hopes to visit the United States next month.\nSalaries of employees were slashed to 270 yuan a month -- China's urban minimum wage -- in July and August and were 600 yuan in September from an average of 2,000 yuan a month in the past, the officials said. About 50 people have resigned, leaving some 300.\nA contractor in Inner Mongolia had sued the Land Group for allegedly defaulting on a contract, and court officials foreclosed on company cars and office equipment in August.\n\"Many people say that this could be what is called in Buddhism an inexorable doom for Mr Mou or the Land Group,\" Chen said.\nChen blamed the woes of Mou on the media \"surrounding and attacking\" him since March as well as a smear campaign by former employees and a government credit squeeze to curb inflation.\n\"But the Land Group will not collapse,\" she said.\nMou plans to raise an unspecified amount of money through a planned share issue, for two Russian-made GALS communications satellites he owns, on the Hong Kong stock exchange, officials said.\nThe first was launched in January 1994 and the second in November 1995. Russia launched both satellites in Kazakhstan.\nIn addition, Mou has bought a 30 percent stake in a company that will develop, manufacture and launch two Russian-made Intersputnik communications satellites.\nThe first of the two satellites is due to be launched from Kazakhstan in late 1998.\nThe satellites were expected to bring Mou net profits of $500 million and bail him out of his current crisis, Chen said.\nThe group has assets worth 1.2 billion yuan and liabilities of just 400 million yuan.\nIt is not Mou's first crisis. He was sentenced to death but eluded execution in the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution for criticising chairman Mao Zedong.\nMou was released from prison in 1979 and established his company the following year. He was arrested again and jailed for one year on a charge of speculating in the early 1980s.\nHe ran up huge debts in the mid 1980s but managed to bounce back by importing small refrigerators from South Korea at low tariff rates, raking in millions of yuan.\n","79":"A group of foreign legal experts has asked China for permission to observe next week's trial of detained dissident Wang Dan, a human rights group said on Saturday.\nWang faces the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death and a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison.\nThe legal team consists of French senator Robert Badinter, former U.S. attorneys-general Nicholas Katzenback and Richard Thornburgh and former Canadian solicitor-general Warren Allmand, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said.\n\"The request ... is in part to see whether the right of Wang Dan to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal ... is respected,\" the human rights group said.\nWang, 26, who vanished into detention in May 1995, would plead not guilty at his Beijing Intermediate People's Court trial which opens on Wednesday, family members have said.\nThe human rights group said the chances of China allowing the foreign legal experts to observe the trial were slim. \"Admittance to the courtroom is often denied to ... journalists and other 'outsiders' on grounds that the courtroom is 'too small',\" Human Rights Watch said.\nWang's court appearance would likely be held out of the public eye, as was last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.\nWang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister have been allowed to sit in.\nThe court has refused to give details of Wang's trial other than the fact that he has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government, but one official has said Wang could appeal to the Higher People's Court if convicted.\nWang's mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, though she has said his health has deteriorated during his detention.\nHuman Rights Watch was not optimistic about an acquittal. \"He has not had adequate time to prepare a defence,\" it said in a statement made available to Reuters by facsimile.\n\"Chinese criminal trials seldom respect the presumption of innocence, and defence lawyers are generally restricted to arguing mitigating circumstances for a reduced sentence,\" the group said.\nWang's family have found a lawyer willing to defend the former student leader after being given just one day in which to do so.\nWang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nHe had been active after his parole in 1993, defying persistent police surveillance to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.\nChina has in recent months cracked down on its tiny band of remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been imprisoned.\n","80":"Hewlett-Packard Co. Monday announced price cuts of up to 41 percent for its computer workstations in a bid to win back market share for its products.\nAnalysts said the move was aimed at reversing recent gains by rival Sun Microsystems Inc. in workstations, the powerful desktop computers used in technical and engineering work.\n\"This price cut is the opening salvo in determining how competitive they're going to be,\" said Joe Ferlazzo, analyst at Technology Business Research in Hampton, N.H.\nThe price cuts range from 27 percent to 41 percent. For example, the price for the higher-end HP Visualize Model C180 equipped with a 20-inch colour monitor was slashed by 32 percent, to $34,995 (corrects price from $43,995) from $51,500.\nAt the lower end, the price of the HP Visualize Model B132l was cut to $6,795 from $11,500, the company said.\nThe new pricing corresponds with Hewlett-Packard's plan to make its workstations more like personal computers by trimming expenses and passing on expected savings to customers.\nThe strategy is aimed at rivals such as Digital Equipment Corp., Silicon Graphics Inc. and especially Sun, widely regarded as the low-cost producer of workstations.\nSun Microsystems raised its market share to 41 percent in the workstation business in 1996, more than its three nearest competitors combined, as the overall workstation market shrank by 1 percent to $15 billion, according to data from International Data Corp, a market research firm.\nManagers at Hewlett-Packard's workstation operations said the new pricing was aimed directly at its competition.\n\"It is a very significant change,\" said Andrew Allison, publisher of the newsletter Inside the New Computing Industry.\n\"HP has not heretofore been a price leader or expressed the intent to be a price-performance leader.\"\nBut Hewlett-Packard's move was unlikely to go unnoticed by rivals in the fiercely competitive sector.\nExecutives at Sun Microsystems, which cut its prices last quarter, told analysts last week it was prepared to make further aggressive price cuts in the power workstation market it now dominates.\n\"Sun is the low-cost producer,\" said Allison. \"Sun is in the best position to deal with this issue and I would expect Sun to respond to HP's moves.\"\n","81":"An outspoken computer security expert, citing his just-completed study, says up to two-thirds of certain Web sites, including reputable institutions like banks and the media, are vulnerable to hacker attacks.\nDan Farmer -- who stirred controversy in 1995 as co-author of software dubbed SATAN that enables people with basic skills to infiltrate computer systems -- surveyed more than 2,200 Web sites.\nThe survey released last week covered a relatively small portion of the sprawling Web but focused on sites where security is more of a concern.\nFarmer probed 660 bank sites around the globe, 312 North American online newspaper sites, 274 credit union sites, 47 U.S. federal government sites and 451 Internet sex clubs.\nIn a summary, Farmer said that, out of his sample of about 1,700 Web sites he selected, \"over 60 percent could be broken into or destroyed.\" As a control, he probed a random sample of 469 sites.\nFarmer said he used relatively crude, non-intrusive methods and did not actually break into the sites. He also said he would not publish the names of the sites he surveyed.\n\"I barely electronically breathed on these (computer) hosts,\" he said in his report, adding that, considering more intrusive tests, some 70 percent to 80 percent of sites may have security flaws.\nOther computer security experts found Farmer's results credible and authoritative, David Kennedy, director of research, education and consulting at the National Computer Security Association, said in a telephone interview Monday.\nExperts and computer industry executives said the study shed more light on a problem well known within the industry but insufficiently understood by the public at large.\nThe threat of hacker attacks was highlighted earlier this year when intruders broke into the Justice Department and Central Intelligence Agency Web sites and altered them, prompting the CIA to close its site temporarily.\nFarmer stressed that Web sites are being used primarily for marketing and advertising purposes and that, although some bank sites may allow visitors to look up balances, the sites do not provide access to internal financial systems.\nDeborah Triant, president of CheckPoint Software Technologies Ltd.'s U.S. operating unit in Redwood City, Calif., said banks routinely keep Web sites on separate computer systems.\n\"Our experience is the banks are so paranoid that they won't even allow the access that they should be able to allow and would be quite safe if you had a modern firewall\" protecting their networks from intruders, said Triant, whose company is the market leader in firewall technology.\n\"So, if their Web site is vulnerable, that doesn't mean that anything else at the bank is vulnerable, or that their customers' accounts or the transactions their customers are doing are vulnerable,\" she said.\nNevertheless, with the advent of electronic commerce over the Internet expected to gain momentum in 1997, lax security remains a critical issue, experts said.\nFarmer separated security flaws into two categories -- a red category where he said a site was \"essentially wide open to any potential attacker\" and a yellow category deemed less serious but with potential for disastrous consequences.\nOf the 660 bank sites, 68 percent were deemed vulnerable and nearly 36 percent were in the red category.\nSome 51 percent of credit unions were vulnerable, 62 percent of the federal sites, nearly 70 percent of newpapers and 66 percent of sex clubs. Sites in the red category ranged from 20 percent for credit unions to 38 percent for federal sites and 39 percent for online newspapers.\nOf the random sample of 469 Web sites used as the control, a far smaller percentage -- 33 percent -- were found to be vulnerable, and 17 percent of the group was in the red category.\nFarmer said part of the problem is that Web sites are trying to do too much at once, increasing their complexity and making security far more difficult to achieve.\nBut, even with security concerns, credit card transactions over the Net are much safer than those carried out in shopping malls, said the security association's Kennedy.\nFarmer also said he plans to incorporate some newer testing tools into a new version of SATAN, which stands for Security Administrator Tool for Analysing Networks, early next year.\nThe programme enables people who manage corporate networks to locate weaknesses and fix them. But it has been controversial because it can also easily be used by malevolent intruders trying to cause damage.\nTriant said there have been no reported security breaches at any of the more than 15,000 institutions with CheckPoint network security installed and said such precautions should provide adequate protection.\n","82":"Apple Computer Inc. is seeking outside investment in its Newton computer unit and is looking for new homes for at least a dozen technology projects it recently decided to stop funding, the struggling computer maker's chief scientist said.\nThe unit responsible for the hand-held Newton computer was spared the axe in a restructuring last month despite speculation it would be closed.\nEarly versions of the highly touted Newton did not make the grade four years ago, but Apple Chief Scientist Larry Tesler said in an interview late Thursday that the unit's latest offerings have been getting rave reviews.\nDemand for its new eMate, a version of the Newton in a stylish clamshell case with a keyboard for schoolchildren and costing around $800, is particularly strong, Tesler said.\nA small group of Apple executives has been assigned to explore alternatives for increasing investment in the Newton business while Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple slashes spending elsewhere in a bid to return to profitability, he said.\nTesler declined to talk about individual companies which Apple may have approached and said he is not directly involved in the group's day-to-day efforts, but said the executives had entered the process with \"an open mind.\"\nThe group was prepared to consider a broad set of options, he said, although he would not say specifically whether these could include a joint venture or some sort of manufacturing or distribution deal, for example.\n\"We are pleased by the reception for the eMate and looking at how we can increase our investment in it at the same time as we lower expenses of the company,\" he said.\nApple's lead scientist said talk of scaling back or exiting the Newton business, which made Apple a pioneer in the hand-held computer market despite its bumpy start, was off target at a time when \"it's just hitting its stride.\"\nIn mid-March, Apple set out to cut spending by an average of 25 percent across the company while abandoning support for an array of technologies in its research labs.\nApple has said it would cut 4,100 jobs and take a $155 million restructuring charge in the second quarter ending March 31. Apple is due to report second-quarter results April 16.\nTesler said Apple was looking for ways to keep its discontinued work alive by licensing it, for example, to third parties \"so these technologies can come to market.\"\n\"They're not ones that fit our business model, but they're ones that we think are good and ought to come to market,\" he said. \"We have one or two dozen technologies that Apple has decided to discontinue and (it is seeking to farm them out) rather than seeing them wither.\"\nTesler declined to give details on what the technologies were, other than the outline given last month in the company's restructuring announcement. He said the method of seeking new sponsors to further develop and market the technologies would differ according to each.\nTesler was attending the Sixth International World Wide Web Conference in Santa Clara, Calif., where he made a presentation to a packed room on some of the newest technology for use in Apple systems.\n","83":"Intel Corp., the world's biggest maker of computer chips, said Tuesday its workers received about $820 million in cash bonuses, profit sharing and retirement pay for the company's record year in 1996.\n\"The average employee received a minimum of about 33 percent payout over their base salary for the year -- about four months of extra income,\" Intel Chief Operating Officer Craig Barrett told reporters in a conference call.\nFor an entry-level hourly worker earing $25,000 a year, the combined package of added compensation and benefits for last year amounts to roughly $8,000 extra, Intel said.\n\"We think it's also been a phenomenal benefit to our shareholders by motivating our employees to do the best possible job they can for our shareholders and our customers,\" said Barrett, who will become Intel's president this spring.\nIntel said the $820 million in 1996 cash profit-sharing and retirement contributions exceeded the company's total 1981 revenues and was roughly equal to its 1991 net income.\nProfits at the Santa Clara-based semiconductor company, which supplies the microprocessors used in four out of every five personal computers shipped, last year soared to $5.2 billion as revenues hit $20.8 billion.\nBarrett said he did not begrudge employees any of the extra benefits from contributing to record results, and the company now plans to make all its employees eligible for stock options beginning with its next plan, which starts in April.\n\"This outstanding year would not have been possible without the remarkable efforts of Intel employees around the world,\" said Barrett, heir apparent to Intel CEO Andy Grove.\nIntel ended 1996 with a workforce of around 48,500.\nSeparately, Intel Chief Financial Officer Andy Bryant told an investment conference in New York City that Intel remained on track in the first quarter to meet its financial targets, as personal computer unit sales continue to grow.\nThe stock of Intel closed up 12.5 cents at $151.75 on the Nasdaq market, where it was third most heavily-traded.\nBarrett said the company last year paid out $214 million, or the equivalent of 26.9 days' salary for each Intel employee, under the Employee Cash Bonus Programme. All employees receive the cash profit-sharing in six-month instalments.\nIn 1996, the company also extended its Employee Bonus profitability-based programme to all employees. The plan, based on growth in Intel earnings and achievement of an employee's business group goals, paid out a total of $360 million.\nA one-time bonus marking Intel's record-breaking year paid $1,000 to each U.S. employee and a locally adjusted figure to each non-U.S. employee, or a total of $45 million.\nIntel said that for the ninth consecutive year it contributed the maximum allowed by law to its employee retirement programme, or 12.5 percent of employees' pay -- a figure which totalled about $200 million.\nIntel has sought to build one of the corporate world's most innovative compensation and benefits packages as a way of attracting top employees and to reward them for contributing to the company's long-term growth and profitability.\nIntel, whose shares have vaulted 180 percent in the past year despite moribund results at many rival semiconductor companies, said it was one of only a small number of companies to have instituted an across-the-board options plan.\nEven the lowest-level hourly workers will receive options to buy a minimum of 50 shares in a five-year plan in which the employee gains one-fifth of the allotment each year.\nBarrett said Intel also spends roughly 6 percent to 7 percent of its payroll, or around $150 million, on employee training each year to help employees advance in their careers.\nBarrett said Intel's generous compensation plan and the hardships at other companies resulted in lower jobs turnover last year. He declined to specify the exact turnover rate, but said \"We're in the relatively low single-digit range.\"\n","84":"U.S. high tech venture fund investment soared 50 percent in the seasonally-slow third quarter vs. overall U.S. venture investment growth of 25 percent from year-ago levels, according to a survey released by Price Waterhouse Monday.\n\"It is so hot it's scary,\" Kirk Walden, who compiles the quarterly Price Waterhouse LLP National Venture Capital Survey, said in an interview.\nVenture investment in high technology industries, from computer software and semiconductors to medical instruments, rose to $1.32 billion in the third quarter, accounting for two-thirds of the $2 billion invested during the period, the survey found.\nSoftware investments alone more than doubled from year-ago levels to $596 million, and in the first nine months of 1996 alone reached $1.74 billion, more than the $1.34 billion recorded for the sector in all of 1995.\nFor the first nine months of 1996, total venture-backed investments in the country reached $7 billion, nearly the $7.5 billion reported for the full year last year.\n\"Based on the current rate of venture capital investments, 1996 will certainly be another record year,\" Donald McGovern, chairman of the Price Waterhouse Technology Industry Group, said in a statement accompanying the results.\nThe third quarter total figure of $2 billion was a sequential drop from the blistering $2.8 billion pace the industry recorded in the second quarter.\n\"Third-quarter numbers are traditionally lower than second-quarter numbers because deal flow slows considerably in the summer months,\" said Carl Thoma, president of the National Venture Capital Association.\n\"But the venture capital industry still remains strong. Good deals are being made across the country in all industries.\"\nCompanies in the start-up and early stages attracted the greatest level of venture capital investment, the study found, with these comprising 46 percent of the 444 companies receiving funds and accounting for $600 million invested.\nOn average start-up companies received more than $3.1 million in funding and, communications firms accounted for nearly 56 percent of the total invested in this category.\nFunding for Internet-related companie continued at the high level set in the second quarter of 1996, with 62 Internet-related companies receiving funding in the quarter exceeding the year-ago period by six times.\nIn a new trend, third quarter venture investment activity appeared to expand beyond the traditionally dominant Silicon Valley and New England areas, whose combined share of investment fell to 33 percent of value invested.\nTypically the two regions account for some 40 percent to 45 percent of the total amount invested by venture funds, and experts said it confirms atriend towards more even distribution.\n\"Nobody in Silicon Valley is going to panic,\" because of the increase in funding outside the key areas, Walden said.\n- sam.perry@reuters.com +1415 846 5400\n","85":"Netscape Communications Corp will on Monday map out a vision on how companies will be able to use its products in the future to coordinate activities between themselves and customers, partners, suppliers and distributors.\nWhile much of the hype surrounding the advent of the World Wide Web has been devoted to new media opportunities, the area with the biggest payback involves a vast network of secured interconnections between companies using Internet technology.  \nInternet analysts and investors in the technologies now expect the market for this variety of electronic commerce to far outstrip even their most upbeat projections for expansion of merchandising and advertising over the Web.\nAnd for software providers such as Internet pioneer Netscape, the market could be even larger than the $10 billion that independent research firms are projecting the Intranet software market may grow to be by the year 2000.  \nMarc Andreessen, Netscape's co-founder and senior vice president of technology, has been talking since the middle of last year about the prospective new market for these so-called \"Extranets\" -- external networks of interlinked corporate Intranets.\n\"Extranets could actually be bigger than Intranets. We'll see,\" Andreessen told Reuters. \"The reason is because if there's 10,000 Intranets out there, then there's 10,000 squared possible connections between them, every one of which is going to involve software.\"  \n\"Right now, if a company wants to build an Extranet between two Intranets, they have to do a lot of work at the network level,\" Andreessen said.\nWith Netscape's software, companies can provide partners with access to parts of their Intranet, making it easier to communicate on projects, he said.\nNetscape, which supplies the world's most popular Internet browser, hopes to develop what it calls \"Crossware\" -- on-demand software applications that run across a multitude of networks and operating systems.  \nNetscape said its own next-generation products -- a client's software for computer users dubbed Mercury and a suite of server products codenamed Apollo -- will be available in early 1998.\nThe announcement is part of a flurry of product introductions expected this week at the industry's Internet World trade show in Los Angeles, and weeks before the final release of Netscape's Communicator package of Internet software, incorporating browsing, electronic mail and group collaboration features.  \nNetscape also hopes its Actra Business Systems joint venture with a division of General Electric Co, will help build products for business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets.\nActra is releasing products before mid-year which will enable electronic data interchange over the Internet, Andreessen said.\nIn a bid to seed this new market, Andreessen said Netscape plans as early as this summer to release a new development tool codenamed Palomar to help developers build crossware applications.\nFor Netscape, the potential Extranet market could be a huge boon. It also promises to be no cakewalk, with rivals Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines Corp's Lotus Development Corp reaching into their own deep pockets to compete aggressively in the field.\nBut Netscape hopes to continue to push its leadership role in Internet software and has lined up partnerships with more than 35 companies around a core set of standards for Extranets.\n","86":"Novell Inc. Tuesday named Eric Schmidt, a prime architect of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Internet and Java language strategy, as its chairman and chief executive officer.\nSchmidt, who will join Novell April 7, will be charged with re-energizing the network software company, which has been involved in a head-to-head battle with software giant Microsoft Corp..\nOver the last 18 months, Novell has managed to dispose of software applications WordPerfect and Quattro Pro, which had been acquired by former Novell chief executive officer Ray Noorda in a failed effort take on industry leader Microsoft.\nAnalysts and industry executives, some of whom were startled by the move, said Schmidt had the energy and intellect to help hone the company's strategy and to draw talented but scarce developers to its ranks.\n\"A lot of guys want to ride at the front,\" one analyst said of Schmidt's move to the chief executive position.\nSchmidt, who joined Sun in 1983 as a manager of software, said the opportunity to run Novell would fulfill \"a lifelong dream\" of heading up a company in the industry.\nIn recent months, Schmidt has emerged as a main spokesman for development of the Internet and of Sun's effort to promote the Java language, designed to enable software to run on virtually all computer systems.\nThese skills will be critical at Novell, analysts said, where former Hewlett-Packard Co. Chairman John Young has been serving as chairman since last August when former Novell CEO Robert Frankenberg stepped down, just as the company was gearing up a new Internet focus.\nYoung will move to the post of vice-chairman.\nChris Le Tocq, an industry analyst at Dataquest, said Schmidt \"will bring the vision\" Novell has been lacking.\nDespite facing competitive pressure from Microsoft, Novell still has the No. 1 market share in network operating systems.\nJoe Marengi, Novell's president and chief operating officer who was serving as acting CEO since Frankenberg's departure, said Novell currently claims 60 million users worldwide.\n\"I think it's a very defensible position and, in fact, one that we can grow very rapidly, in my personal view,\" Schmidt said of Novell's market position.\nIn addition to competing with Microsoft in advanced networking features, Schmidt said the company will work to make sure its software works well on both Microsoft's Windows NT and Unix networking environments.\nSchmidt received a degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University and a doctorate in computer science from the University of California at Berkeley. He has worked at Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center, at Bell Laboratories and Zilog Inc.\n","87":"Wired magazine remains one of the publishing world's hottest 1990s startups, but on the brink of its parent's initial stock offering some analysts are warning the chronicle of the digerati of the Internet age may prove a better read than investment.\n\"It's a great read, off Wall Street, but the balance sheet is not quite as neo-designed as the magazine,\" said Steve Harmon, senior investment analyst at Mecklermedia's iWORLD.\nThe initial public offering of Wired Ventures Inc., the publisher of the magazine, were due to be priced late on Thursday, according to lead underwriter Goldman Sachs.\nThe offering had been initially due in July but was pulled at the last minute as the market for technology and Internet stocks was tumbling.\nNow Internet stocks, most of which have only gone public since the Netscape Communication Corp.'s milestone offering in August 1995, have rebounded nearly 10 percent from their July lows.\nWired Ventures' revised offering has reduced the company's projected market capitalisation by some $200 million, or 42 percent, from its initial plan, according to Harmon, who calculated the company's new market capitalisation at some $300 million based on an IPO price of $13 a share.\nWired intends to sell up to 4.75 million shares at a range of $12 to $14 a share to raise gross proceeds of $61.75 million. This compares with its earlier plan to raise $76 million from sale of 6.3 million shares.\nIPO analysts said the company was wise to hold off on its initial offering, enabling it to take advantage of the current pickup in new share offerings coming to market.\nSome Internet analysts also said the offering faces a market that is becoming more discerning than in the past, when investors snapped up shares of companies which had minimal operating history and little promise of near-term profits.\n\"I think they're going to have a little bit of a challenge with this one. It's just fundamentals,\" said one analyst. \"A couple of years ago, when the Internet was just starting, you could have taken your dog named 'Net' public.\"\nMany investors and analysts compare Wired with traditional print media, since some 90 percent of its revenues are still derived from its high-tech monthly, which since 1993 has been promoted as the magazine of the digital revolution.\nEarly investors in Wired have included high tech guru Nicholas Negroponte, who heads the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Labs, and publisher S.I. Newhouse.\nWired continues to be among the fastest-growing publishing properties, growing in circulation from 90,000 at the end of 1993, its first year of publication, to an estimated 325,000 in August, according to the company's offering documents.\nThe company also runs HotWired, a hip Web site geared for those who want to keep on the leading edge of digital developments, and the search engine HotBot.\nBut IPO experts note the business plan for the Internet operations was still in early development and the company continues to post heavy losses, with a net loss for the first six months of 1996 of $34.7 million, including a $20.5 million writeoff, more than double its revenues of $15.63 million.\nAt an expected price of some 7.3 times estimated 1996 revenues, the valuation would be cheaper than recent Internet content companies like CNET Inc., which has traded at 20 times 1996 revenues, or Yahoo! Inc., which has been trading at more than 40 times estimated 1996 revenues.\nBut this is pricey compared to more conventional print media valuations, where two times revenues is often the norm, and four to five times for properties exhibiting strong growth in an otherwise maturing sector, analysts said.\n\"Wired changed journalism, especially high-tech journalism, and made it cool,\" said Harmon, adding that investors may have difficulty valuing this in financial terms.\n\"I think Wired expected everybody to just assume it was the emperor emeritus of the digital world and that everything they did turned to gold,\" he said.\n","88":"A Silicon Valley company has developed a new technology designed to turn the World Wide Web from a random, hit-or-miss quest into a highly targeted personal service that it says can change to suit your mood.\nThe new service, known as The Angle, is available immediately as a showcase for Los Altos, Calif.-based BroadVision Inc.'s One-to-One technology for personalizing the World Wide Web.\nThe technology enables a person to set up an individual profile, or \"angle,\" combining personal interests and preferred style to customise the \"look and feel\" of the Web service.\nUsers can also chose from several \"personalities\" to try out different ways of viewing information on the Internet, or choose different profiles for different moods -- such as one for the business day and another for use at home.\n\"We give the user the remote control,\" Broadvision said in materials prepared for the formal unveiling Tuesday of The Angle site, at the URL  http:\/\/www.theangle.com.\n\"We put you in the driver's seat. As you change, so do your information needs,\" the company said.\nUse of the site is free of charge and requires no registration. Profiling information is stored only for the benefit of users, the company said, to ensure privacy and enable them to change their profile at any time.\nPehong Chen, the founder, president and chief executive of BroadVision, said the technology would serve not only as a showcase, but would enable large organisations to develop co-branded sites based on the BroadVision product.\n\"Seeing is believing,\" he told Reuters in an interview. \"People can choose a personality, somebody they can relate to, or disguise themselves as sombody else ... This makes it fun and easy to understand.\"\nChen said the company is targeting a Global 1000 list of large companies for developing both co-branded services and for using the technology internally in private networks known as Intranets to communicate with individual employees.\nIt has already begun collaborating with Web partners and formed a new division, the Content Services Group, to provide software products, consulting services and original content for both consumers and consumer-oriented businesses.\nThe Angle is the first application developed by the group, which is also releasing a Web-based distributed multi-user Intranet application called WebPoint, which handles calendar, workflow and communications among publishers and editorial staff involved in creating and maintaining Web sites.\nEditors in the group also provide a Web Site rating system which can point users to sites with a \"Look Before You Link\" feature providing data on how easy a site is to use, its graphics intensity, level of innovation and interactivity and update frequency before even entering the site.\nBroadVision has signed a charter co-branding partnership agreement with Virgin Communications of London. Branded as \"The Virgin Angle\", the service will include additional UK perspectives and is due to be available in the fourth quarter.\nThe new division is also advising Minneapolis-based Netradio Networks on \"The Netradio Angle,\" which is designed to be a music Web site recomendation service.\nBroadVision completed an initial public offering of stock in June and Chen said the company is currently ahead of its business plan.\n","89":"Netscape Communications Corp. on Wednesday raised the ante in the Internet software wars, announcing a price increase effective April 1 as it prepares to release new products this spring.\nNetscape also introduced a five-level support program, beginning next month, which allows customers to pick the level of service they are willing to pay for.\nThe price of Communicator, the integrated communications package which includes Netscape's Navigator browser, will rise to $59 from $49, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company said. Its enterprise server software, used on the server computers that run networks, will cost $1,295, up from $995.\nUnder the new pricing, Netscape will charge an average 10 percent to 15 percent more for service, it said.\nBut, by delaying the price increases until April 1, Netscape has made a pre-release version of Communicator a more attractive buy and positioned itself for higher sales this quarter, executives said.\nPeople who pay now for the software, which is available in a preview version, will be able to get the final version for free when it becomes available in the next quarter.\nMichael Homer, Netscape's vice president of marketing, said the new prices still offer a better deal than rival products from Microsoft Corp. and the Lotus Development Corp. unit of International Business Machines Corp..\nLotus President Jeff Papows quickly challenged that and accused Netscape executives of \"childish behavior\" in making pricing comparisons that Papows said were misleading.\n\"There's very little difference in the price points, actually,\" Papows said after making a presentation to a Goldman Sachs conference at which Netscape's vice president of engineering, Eric Hahn, disclosed the price increases.\n\"Our servers are much cheaper to acquire,\" he said, noting that Lotus Domino server software is priced at $2,995 compared with Netscape's SuiteSpot 3.0, which allows customers to chose five of its nine server products for $3,995, or $4,995 after April 1.\nA Microsoft executive also disputed Netscape's pricing claim.\n\"Our browser and our server are still free, so we've got to be less expensive,\" said Mike Nash, a marketing director in the company's personal and business systems group.\nMicrosoft's Internet Explorer browser is free for all platforms, and its Internet Information Service is included as a feature of the Windows NT Server operating systems for large networks.\nThe three companies are competing fiercely in the fast-growing market for electronic mail, scheduling and so-called workgroup software for intranets, the corporate networks that make use of cost-effective Internet technologies.\nNetscape stock rose 87.5 cents to $35.625, and Microsoft climbed $1.375 to $99.875, both on the Nasdaq market. IBM rose 12.5 cents to $144.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nHomer said a configuration for 1,000 users combining Communicator and Netscape's server software only costs $58 per user computer -- just $23 a user for those already using Navigator -- compared to $77 for Lotus.\nBut Papows contested this, saying the true list price figure would be around $58, or roughly the same.\n\"They are quoting irrelevent data, doing it deliberately, and posting it to their Web site,\" he said, adding he recently discussed his concerns with Homer and Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale.\nThe Lotus executive added, however, that he expects the market for all players to continue to expand briskly, with Lotus aiming to increase the number of electronic mail users of its software by up to 8.5 million this year to 18 million.\n\"We're doing enormously well. I suspect they're doing well, too. There's a big market,\" he said, adding Netscape \"ought to be well credited for invigorating the Internet market.\"\nHomer said Netscape's price advantage was even greater, according to recent studies by third parties, when the total cost of acquiring, installing and using its systems was taken into account, including training and other factors.\n","90":"Intel Corp. executives said late Tuesday the company has agreed to invest cash and technical know-how in a new company to deliver multimedia content by satellite to personal computers across Europe.\nIntel said the investment, to be formally announced at the CeBIT technology trade fair in Hannover, Germany, on Wednesday, will be Intel's first investment in personal computer delivery services, although it has sought to foster other technologies that can help drive the use of personal computers worldwide.\nIntel will hold a minority stake in the newly formed European Satellite Multimedia Services S.A. (ESM), said Leslie Vadasz, Intel senior vice president and director of corporate business development.\n\"Europe has a lot of satellite use, so it was an obvious place,\" to begin such a service, Vadasz told Reuters. \"There is a need to provide a new kind of service for PC users.\"\nIndustry sources valued the Intel investment at $15 million, with Luxenbourg's Societe Europeenne des Satellite (SES) holding a majority stake in the new company, which will also be based in Luxenbourg.\nIntel executives declined to comment on the cash value of the deal, but said the company would also be contributing technology to the endeavor, and hopes to bring in partners capable of supplying multimedia content to the venture.\n\"Part of our contribution will be technology. Part of it will be our relationship with many of our customers, content and media companies,\" Vadasz said in an interview.\nOther investors are expected to be announced in the near future, he said. Negotiations with prospective investors aere under way, he said, but he declined to elaborate.\nThe new company will launch ASTRA-NET, a system for communications using SES's ASTRA satellite system already in place. The first business-to-business communications links will be operational in the second half of this year.\nESM is expected to eventually bring PC services to European homes much as increasingly popular satellite television services, like BSkyB, have done for TV.\nIntel noted that more than 16 million personal computers bought in Europe last year, according to the research firm Dataquest, and 23 million European households have direct access to ASTRA satellite transmissions.\nASTRA-NET reception throughout Europe will require 50-60 centimeter satellite dish, less than two feet in diameter, connected to a PC equipped with a high-performance Intel Pentium microprocessor and a PC card which is compatible with Europe's Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) transmissions.\nIntel said business data can be sent to servers at speeds up to 38 megabits per second, well above the 56 kilobit speeds of leading-edge telephone modems or the 128 kilobits per second rates of Integrated Digital Services Network (ISDN).\nSpeeds of six megabits per second to the home will be possible, with technology likely to be available by the year 2000 which could enable two-way satellite traffic.\nAt first, traffic will be broadcast-only, however, with the capcity to send data and multimedia programming at speeds hundreds of times faster than over conventional phones.\n\"As satellite technology moves along, there's be more and more opportunity to do an on-demand type of service,\" such as higher-speed Internet browsing. \"Initially, this will be a push technology only.\"\nVadasz said Intel's work on developing technology for cable modems and on Ethernet local area network (LAN) adapters can be brought to bear in the project. Intel also has been working on a wireless data standard dubbed Intercast.\nVadasz has argued that PC communications have lagged wellbehind other technologies, stating in a recent editorial letter to the San Jose Mercury News that such services could result in more than $10 billion in annual U.S. sales alone.\nTo foster such a market, he wrote, higher bandwidth connections with instant access, multimedia integration, security and affordable pricing were necessary features.\n((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400))\n","91":"The legal barrage by Netscape Communications Corp. against arch-rival Microsoft Corp. may end up dampening investors' enthusiasm for both stocks, analysts said on Wednesday.\nGary Reback, Netscape's outside counsel at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, has urged the Department of Justice to take immediate action against Microsoft for alleged violations of its 1994 consent decree and antitrust laws.\nSeparately, Tim O'Reilly, head of Internet publisher O'Reilly &amp; Associates, said he was recently approached by a Justice Department official asking about Microsoft's behaviour, perhaps indicating fresh interest in the matter.\nMicrosoft, which has weathered legal battles successfully in the past, has rebuffed the allegations, saying Netscape's claims are \"full of wild and unsubstantiated statements.\"\nThe software giant went on the offensive Wednesday, accusing Netscape of failing to live up to its own promises that it would support open Internet standards.\n\"Netscape should take a good look at themselves in the mirror,\" said Brad Chase, vice president or marketing for Microsoft's Internet division, noting Netscape had blocked users of Microsoft's browser from parts of the Netscape site.\nNevertheless, analysts noted the market has a distaste for legal uncertainty, and investors were likely to start factoring in at least some degree of risk that the battle could escalate into a full-fledged government investigation or lawsuit.\n\"The legal risk is starting to get heightened on this,\" said Montgomery Securities analyst David Readerman, who covered Microsoft during Apple Computer Inc.'s failed five-year copyright lawsuit against the software giant.\nMicrosoft also was probed by the Federal Trade Commission and, subsequently, the Justice Department for five years until its July 1994 signing of a consent decree agreeing to alter the way it licenses operating system software.\nThat accord was viewed by some of its software rivals as having been lenient, and Netscape's lawyer asked the Justice Department in a letter released Tuesday to examine whether Microsoft was now using its control over computer operating systems improperly.\nIn both cases, analysts noted that the hint of further legal difficulties could dampen further advances in the companies' stocks as the market seeks to sort out the business impact, if any.\n\"We've been there with the Apple vs Microsoft and we've been there with the (Justice Department) and the experience is that these stocks tend to stall as the market tries to figure out what the risk is all about,\" said Readerman.\nMicrosoft stock closed up 12.5 cents at $123.50, while Netscape was unchanged at $37.25, both on Nasdaq.\nLawyers in Washington, D.C., said they doubt the Justice Department would find Microsoft had acted improperly, based on the charges leveled against the company by Netscape.\nMountain View, Calif.-based Netscape alleged through its letter to the DOJ that Microsoft had offered \"clandestine side payments\" and discounts on its operating system, and other inducements, to promote use of its own Internet browser.\nThe lawyers contacted by Reuters noted that while Microsoft dominates the PC operating system market with around a 90 percent share, Netscape has an estimated 80 percent share of the market for Internet browser software.\n\"In the browser category, Netscape is the elephant and Microsoft is the mouse,\" said Robert Skitol of Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath. \"It's a bit of a stretch to call what Microsoft is described as doing a violation of the consent decree or a violation of antitrust laws.\"\n","92":"While Internet stocks have taken center stage in the investment arena alongside such high-tech stalwarts as Intel Corp and Cisco Corp, many investors are wary about what 1997 will bring.\nTech sector stocks have sagged amid uncertainty over the 1997 market outlook.\nWith growth of the PC market expected to moderate further despite a strong business upgrade cycle, investment in technology stocks is shifting somewhat towards value investing from momentum players,  according to some investors and analysts at the annual Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. technology conference here.\n\"People are still suffering from too much money  and too much volatility and they're not sure when it's all going to stop,\" said Keith Benjamin, a Robertson Stephens senior research analyst covering Internet media content and services companies.\nInvestors also said they are being more selective than a year ago, when Internet stocks were the rage and bankers joked that you could write \"Internet\" on a dollar bill and take it public for $10.\n\"Investors are looking for stable revenue streams here, annuity-type businesses,\" said one investor for a European fund.\nSome investors also expressed frustration at the process of sifting through myriad business plans -- some 70 of the more than 350 companies presenting here this week were Internet related, many taking the center stage over more established firms.\n\"I don't think they have any idea what their business plan is,\" said another investor, shaking his head as he left the room after a presentation of one well-known Internet startup.\n\"There are very few opportunities and so much money out there looking for them,\" said Robert Herwick, head of Herwick Capital Management, noting the recent sell-off in networking stocks could also have repercussions for shares of hot chip-makers supplying the communications market.\nMany of these fast-growing companies had held their value last year despite the slump in the rest of the semiconductor sales at the time amid a flood of new semiconductor capacity and Herwick says investors may even be experiencing a bottoming of high tech sentiment now.\nDespite some bullish comments about spot prices of 16-megabit computer memory chips by companies like Micron Technologies Inc., which said this week spot prices for the chips have risen 50 percent in recent weeks, executives remain cautious.\nMicron's chairman, Steven Appleton, warned that although markets exaggerate the up and down cycles of the semiconductor business, it is folly to ever believe these swings will disappear.\nLikewise, Herwick said some semiconductor executives are worried about further capacity coming on-line despite the apparent efforts of Korean chipmakers to curb output, and this could impact pricing for the next-generation  64-bit memory chips in the second half.\nSeveral of the Internet companies stressed, as they had in their initial share offering documents, that they have limited operating histories and are focused foremost on gaining market share and revenues.\n\"There's one thing on our minds, and that's revenue,\" said Bruce Wilson, executive vice president of CyberCash, Inc., at a presentation late Thursday.\nFurther consolidation is expected in the Internet space.\nThe on-line chat company iChat noted in its presentation here that 99 percent of all Internet traffic is already commanded by less then one percent of all sites, and others said this concentration is only expected to increase.\nForrester Research CEO George Colony said he expects many leaders in existing physical markets will successfully enter and dominate the on-line world as well, over time.\nReferring to Amazon.com, the Seattle-based Internet bookseller which currently runs one of the hottest Internet merchant sites, Colony said established companies may yet come to dominate space.\n\"Do you think three to four years from now Amazon.com will be a major brand?\" he asked in a panel discussion this week. \"I call them Amazon.toast.\"\nIn an apparently unrelated decision, Amazon.com, the company, canceled its presentation at the conference, Robertson Stephens announced.

Many, though, are at such an early stage of financing that the $50,000 fee for a booth at Comdex would have been too costly.\nAlthough there was an abrupt slowdown in Internet initial public offerings over the summer, analysts and investors expect the market to heat up again.\nThe pace of venture investment may not continue at its red-hot rate of the second quarter, when Price Waterhouse LLP reported 556 firms received $2.8 billion in venture capital, up 32 percent from a year earlier. But new investment appears poised to top the 1995 record of $7.5 billion.\n\"Judging by preliminary numbers, it is virtually assured that 1996 is going to be a record year,\" said Kirk Walden, who is compiling the firm's third-quarter venture capital survey.\nWalden said venture capital funds invested $5.2 billion in the first nine months of 1995.\n\"The technology category continues to be what's driving overall investment,\" he added.\nTechnologic Partners' Shaffer admits it remains a difficult task for investors to sort out which companies will be a success in markets that may take years to develop despite the intense interest and hype surrounding the Internet.\nFurthermore, many startup companies have been forced to reinvent themselves with frequently updated business plans as the fast-paced Internet market evolves.\n\"It's initially going to be a very big market for a lot of players, and it will be quite some time before we know what the best business models are,\" Shaffer said. \"Developing the Internet and electronic commerce ... is going to be a decades-long process. We're just at the beginning.\"\n","94":"Sun Microsystems Inc. stock took a beating Wednesday despite reporting a sharp rise in earnings that topped Wall Street's average forecasts and set milestones for its typically weak first fiscal quarter.\nThe Mountain View, Calif.-based computer maker said late Tuesday that its profits jumped 45 percent in its fiscal first quarter to $123.4 million, or 63 cents a share, from $84.7 million, or 42 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. It cited continued strong sales of its computer workstations.\nThe profits were a shade above Wall Street analysts' average forecast of 61 cents a share as compiled by First Call, which tracks earnings estimates, but investors started taking profits in after-hours trading Tuesday.\nTraders noted the stock had run up ahead of the report, and that while Sun's numbers were strong, they were not as strong as had some on Wall Street had been expecting.\nFurthermore, some analysts expressed concerns over whether Sun will be able to match the performance in the future in an increasingly competitive market for workstations as rivals introduce new models of their own.\nThe stock of the Mountain View, Calif.-based computer maker touched its all-time high of $70.25 Tuesday before the earnings report and ended regular trading at $70. But it fell $4 in after-hours trading following the report.\nThe freefall continued Wednesday, with the shares off as much as $7.625 at one point at a session low of $62.375 and closing the day at $63.125, down $6.875 on Nasdaq trading volume of nearly 18 million shares. It was the most actively traded stock on the exchange.\n\"We've got to believe there's some profit-taking going on,\" Sun Chairman Scott McNealy told reporters in a conference call Tuesday when informed of the after-hours decline.\nA number of analysts trimmed their ratings on the 14-year-old computer maker, mostly saying the stock's price had already soared to near their 12-month trading targets and that the downgrades were based on valuation rather than fndamentals.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Steve Mulunovich, for example, cut his rating to \"outperform\" from a \"strong buy\", with a price target of $75 on the stock. However, he also raised his fiscal 1997 earnings estimate to $3.35 a share from $3.30.\nThe company reported record earnings per share of $2.42 in its 1996 fiscal year, which ended in June.\nAlex. Brown analyst Phil Rueppel also cut his rating, to a \"buy\" from a \"strong buy\" and Ferman Selz removed the stock from its recommended list after it hit its $70 price target.\nA few analysts also expressed concern that although Sun has received a great deal of publicity over its Java technology, it also will face stiff competition from rivals Hewlett-Packard Co. and Silicon Graphics Inc., which have just introduced speedy new computer models.\nOther competitors, like personal computer maker Compaq Computer Corp., are also expected to jump into the market with workstations to compete in the high-end market for machines which has long been dominated by a handful of firms.\n\"His new competitors are Compaq and Dell Computer. The enemy isn't the traditional competitor but a new class of people that can compete in this space,\" said David Wu, an analyst at Chicago Corp.\nSun scored a small coup Wednesday by hiring Mark Canepa -- a Hewlett-Packard veteran who was just named by Compaq last month to head up its newly formed workstation division -- to instead be vice president of Sun's Workgroup Server Products Group.\nStock in Compaq, whose third quarter earnings also surpassed Wall Street estimates, also fell, closing down $1.50 ato $73.625 in New York Stock Exchange trading.\nSome analysts said they saw the weakness in Sun's stock as a buying opportunity.\nDean Witter analyst Jay Stevens said he raised his earnings estimates for Sun and reiterated a buy rating.\n\"They delivered a very fine quarter,\" Stevens said.\n","95":"High technology venture fund investment soared 50 percent in the third quarter as overall U.S. venture investment rose 25 percent in the seasonally slow period from year-ago levels, according to a recent survey.\n\"It is so hot it's scary,\" Kirk Walden, who compiles the quarterly Price Waterhouse LLP National Venture Capital Survey, said in an interview. The survey was released Friday.\nHigh technology industries, from computer software and semiconductors to medical instruments, rose to $1.32 billion in the third quarter, accounting for two-thirds of the $2 billion invested during the period, the survey found.\nSoftware investments alone more than doubled from year-ago levels to $596 million, and in the first nine months of 1996 reached $1.74 billion, more than the $1.34 billion recorded for the sector in all of 1995.\nFor the first nine months of 1996, total venture-backed investments in the country reached $7 billion, nearly the $7.5 billion reported for the full year last year.\n\"Based on the current rate of venture capital investments, 1996 will certainly be another record year,\" Donald McGovern, chairman of the Price Waterhouse Technology Industry Group, said in a statement accompanying the results.\nThe third-quarter total figure of $2 billion was a sequential drop from the blistering $2.8 billion pace the industry recorded in the second quarter.\n\"Third-quarter numbers are traditionally lower than second-quarter numbers because deal flow slows considerably in the summer months,\" said Carl Thoma, president of the National Venture Capital Association.\n\"But the venture capital industry still remains strong. Good deals are being made across the country in all industries.\"\nCompanies in the startup and early stages attracted the greatest level of venture capital investment, the study found, with these comprising 46 percent of the 444 companies receiving funds and accounting for $600 million invested.\nOn average, startup companies received more than $3.1 million in funding and communications firms accounted for nearly 56 percent of the total invested in this category.\nFunding for Internet-related companies continued at the high level set in the second quarter, with 62 Internet-related companies receiving funding in the quarter, exeeding the year-ago period by six times.\nIn a new trend, third-quarter venture investment activity appeared to expand beyond the traditionally dominant Silicon Valley and New England areas, whose combined share of investment fell to 33 percent of value invested.\nTypically, the two regions account for some 40 to 45 percent of the total amount invested by venture funds, and experts said it confirms a trend towards more even distribution.\n","96":"Sun Microsystems Inc on Wednesday unveiled its first mainframe-class server, marking its entry into a $50 billion market for data-center computer hardware, storage, software and services.\nEd Zander, president of the company's Sun Microsystems Computer Co, said he expected the machines to sell for an average price of more than $1 million.  \nSpeaking to a a gathering of analysts, customers and reporters at San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art, Zander cautioned that the new Ultra Enterprise 10000 servers, which can compete with mainframe computers on many measurements of computing performance, would have a longer sales cycle than Sun's more traditional Unix product lines.\nStill, he said Sun expected to sell more of its speedy Ultra Enterprise 5000 and 6000 midrange servers as a result of its new high-end machine, which is available immediately to launch customers. It will begin shipping in volume in March.  \n\"It really puts Sun into some new markets where they have not been able to play before,\" said C.B. Lee, senior analyst at Sutro &amp; Co.\nLee said the new server would be most useful for running complex database applications and for extending new computing capabilities, rather than replacing older software and hardware that have come to be known as legacy systems.  \nMontgomery Securities analyst Kurt King said by extending Sun's capabilities at the high end, the new machines may help overall investor sentiment by allaying somewhat the fears of competition at the lower end of Sun's product line from PCs based on Intel chips and Microsoft Windows.\n\"It expands Sun's business,\" he said, adding it would inevitably help boost margins and help move the mix toward servers and away from the Unix workstation market. Sun dominates that market but Intel and Windows NT are challenging its lead.\nThe base Starfire configuration -- 16 processors and two gigabytes of memory -- will be priced around $870,000.  \nSun officials declined to comment specifically on margin and revenue or earnings expectations, although John Shoemaker, who heads Sun's enterprise server and storage group, repeated that Sun aimed to become the leading midrange server supplier.\nIt is currently third behind International Business Machines Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co, analysts said. Shoemaker said Sun estimated its rate of growth to be two to three times that of its archrivals, however.\n\"We think we have a realistic objective in about three years to be number one,\" he said. \"We are significantly gaining share on our competitors.\"  \nSun said its 10000 series, codenamed 'Starfire', offers up to four times the performance of IBM's CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) mainframe and HP T-series servers.\nZander said the company's sales force would market the machines aggressively. \"This is a hunk of Iron,\" he said after the machine was brought onto stage using a turntable. \"Bring back the old days -- gross margin, revenue,\" he said.\nBecause it runs Sun's Solaris version of Unix, the 10000 series also can run 12,000 Solaris-based applications.\nShares of Sun fell 68 cents to $32.75 in Nasdaq trade.  \nSun also announced storage products, including its RSM Array 2000, which supports up to 20 terabytes for the 10000. It will begin shipping in February for Solaris servers.\nThe RSM Array 2000 is priced at $0.49 per megabyte, sharply lower than the $1.75 per megabyte and $1.08 per megabyte it said new EMC machines cost.\nSun said it would offer Veritas Software Corp's Veritas File System disk and information management system with its storage products, and it demonstrated it on the RSM Array 2000.

The earnings report will serve as a critical barometer of whether strong corporate earnings can keep underpinning stock values.\nIndustry analysts said Intel's quarterly price cuts on Pentium processors are expected to lead to slightly lower prices for personal computers. Some speculated that in expectation of rival chips, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s new K6, Intel will cut Pentium prices more than usual, from 25 percent to 30 percent.\n\"This continues to fuel normal PC demand,\" said Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest Inc in San Jose, Calif. \"This is the normal stuff that keeps stimulating the market.\"\nAccording to First Call, which tracks Wall Street estimates, analysts expect Intel to report a first-quarter profit of $2.07 a share, up from $1.02 a year ago, when Intel posted net income of $894 million on revenues of $4.64 billion.\nIf Intel meets those expectations, it will be the second straight quarter in which the world's largest maker of computer chips has more than doubled its year-on-year profits.\nAn Intel spokesman said the company could not comment this close to its earnings report, but the company said in mid-March -- within two weeks of the close of the quarter -- that market fundamentals \"remain very strong.\"\nIntel executives told analysts in January they expect revenues to be around $6.4 billion, about even with what it reported in the fourth quarter. Gross margins -- the difference between revenue and the costs of goods -- are expected to be even with or below the fourth quarter's 63 percent.\nAnalysts said Intel's bellwether role -- it has recently made a habit of re-energizing flagging stock markets with particularly upbeat earnings reports -- is especially crucial given Wall Street's current moodiness.\nWall Street is particularly wary of the outlook for corporate earnings following the Federal Reserve's March 25 decision to raise interest rates and fresh speculation about chances of another rate increase based on Friday's report of underlying price pressures at the wholesale level in March.\n\"People are scared. Intel is one of the biggest holdings and they can still sell it at a profit,\" said David Wu, high-tech analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. \"They're scared because tech stocks are going down. If technology stocks can't do corporate earnings, you can forget about the rest.\nAnalysts said the much-heralded \"whisper\" number for Intel is for it to make $2.15 a share, and that even $2.20 a share could be possible given another blow-out quarter.\nBut, one analyst cautioned, \"anything less than $2.15 would not be good\" for the market.\nMarket researcher Dataquest said last week that Intel will continue to dominate the personal computer industry, where its processors currently account for 95 percent of the market, although clone-makers will start to make inroads this year.\nIntel spokesman Howard High said Friday the company will continue with its routine quarterly pricing changes, but that he saw no unusual changes in the upcoming pricing pattern from that to which the PC industry has grown accustomed.\n\"We do our price declines in a pretty predictable, orderly fashion,\" he said.\nAnalysts expect Intel to cut some prices when it unveils its new high-end Pentium II chip next month, and High said Intel's practice is to \"move other products down a notch\" to make room for the new processors.\n\"The movement is always in a relatively consistent direction, which is down. The rate is dependent on market conditions ... They (the pricing reductions) seem to have been pretty constant over the years,\" he added.\nIn February, Intel's pricing changes for its Pentium and Pentium Pro family of microprocessors ranged from no change at all to roughly a 34 percent decline, he noted.\nIntel's processors range in price from around $100 for the lower-end, older models to over $1,000 for the highest-end chips.\n","100":"The great Internet gold rush may be over, some high-technology industry executives say, but they see a silver lining: continued growth for leading high-tech companies.\n\"The Internet gold rush is over. We've had this big phenomenon, but there's not a lot of gold there,\" Frank Gill, executive vice president and general manager of Intel Corp.'s Internet and Communications Group, said in an interview on the eve of Wednesday's Spring Internet World 97 conference.\nGill is one of five keynote speakers at the Los Angeles conclave, which is expected to produce a blizzard of new product announcements from Internet start-up companies, many of them based in California's Silicon Valley.\nIn additon to Intel's Gill, top executives from computer makers Apple Computer Co., International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. are expected to speak at the conference.\nThe Internet start-up explosion reached its peak nearly a year ago, when some Internet companies changed the rules of raising money in stock markets, where three years of profitability were considered a prerequisite for going public.\nYahoo! Inc., for example, went public at a valuation that peaked in initial trading at over $1 billion on its first day of trading despite less than a year of full operating history and no assurance of profits in the foreseeable future.\nDespite the brakes applied to the Internet public offering market last summer, venture capital investment continues at a strong pace and major corporations are now going onto the World Wide Web, which continues to grow at a rapid clip.\nStart-ups with innovative products -- including technology that \"pushes\" news and software content to users instead of making them go out and get it and so-called intelligent agents that help sift through the huge mass of data on the Internet -- are expected to flock to the conference floor hoping to flaunt their wares.\n\"I don't think the number of start-ups will slow down (but) their dreams for (stock) valuations will be more realistic,\" said Gill, who is due to address the conference Thursday.\nNow people are \"hunkering down\" to focus on providing value to consumers and value to business, Gill said, adding that Intel itself has invested in smaller companies with pioneering technology and sought to foster new technologies, such as modems that run on cable televison systems and making telephone calls over the Internet.\nGill sees JamTV, a new online music network developed with Digital Entertainment Networks, as an example of new Internet capabilities which also drive demand for higher-performance computers.\nFor Intel, he said, the Internet is a \"wonderful opportunity\" because it could drive demand for more PC sales.\nThe Internet World conference will be the next battleground in the war between Internet pioneer Netscape Communications Corp. and software giant Microsoft Corp. for leadership in the Internet software market.\nIt also will give Apple Computer Chief Executive Gil Amelio another chance Wednesday to spell out his struggling company's Internet strategy, which he has said is core to its turnaround efforts, just two days before he is due to announce further layoffs in a fresh restructuring.\nWhatever the plight of individual companies, industry executives at a conference held near San Francisco Tuesday said they saw no slowdown in Internet demand.\n\"We've seen over 300 percent growth in our backbone in 1996,\" said Robert Hagens, director of MCI Communications Corp.'s Network MCI Service, referring to the company's core Internet service lines.\n","101":"For managers at the trendy specialty juicer Odwalla Inc., the revelation that their apple juice products were associated with a potentially deadly outbreak of E. coli food poisoning has come as a shock.\nThe company, headquartered in the easy-going coast community of Half Moon Bay, was founded 16 years ago on the premise that fresh, natural fruit juices nourish the spirit.\nCompany executives were morose as they met reporters for the first time on Thursday in the parking lot of the company's modest building, across a creek from the town center.\n\"It is very tough, to be honest, to be focused on health and nutrition all of your life and have this incident happen,\" Greg Steltenpohl said. He founded the business with a childhood friend in Santa Cruz in 1980, using a used juicing machine in a shed behind their house.\nOdwalla has grown by more than 40 percent a year, with annual sales in its fiscal year to Aug. 31, 1996, surging 65 percent to $59.2 million. It is now estimated to account for more than 70 percent of the fresh-juice market in the seven Western states it serves, together with Vancouver, British Columbia.\nThe company prides itself on using cold processing, which it says leaves vegetable and other biological nutrients intact, and on a rapid store distribution system. Its marketing emphasizes freshness and the absence of pasteurization and artificial additives or preservatives.\nEven its name, from a song poem by the Art Ensemble of Chicago jazz group, displays a sense of mission. The Odwalla is a leader who guided the \"lost people of the sun\" out of the \"gray haze\" -- of \"overprocessed foods\" in this case.\nSteltenpohl and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Williamson said Odwalla had mobilized its 175 trucks and drivers, armed with hand-held computers, to recover recalled bottles from the shelves of more than 4,600 outlets in California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas and Vancouver.\nExecutives immediately offered to refund the purchase price of any of the company's drinks, even those not among the 16 out of 23 fruit varieties recalled. They also said the company would pay for medical treatment for anyone found to have become ill through drinking an Odwalla product.\nAlthough Williamson said the company had product liability insurance that he believed would cover the incident, the executives declined to answer questions about the financial impact of the recall and any subsequent actions.\nOdwalla shares were up $1.13 at $13.25 by Friday afternoon after shedding roughly a third of their value on Thursday.\nJean-Michel Valette, an analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist, said publicity surrounding the recall would hurt sales but with insurance and $14 million in cash, \"Odwalla has the resources to weather the storm.\"\nOdwalla, which takes the precaution of keeping samples of each batch of juice it produces, is working with the Food and Drug Administration and Washington state authorities to determine how contamination might have occurred and how widespread it was.\nBut company officials said it was too soon to question their philosophy.\n","102":"Sun Microsystems Inc. and its partners will Wednesday launch initiatives aimed at making its Java computing platform more speedy on devices ranging from smart cards to supercomputers.\nJust two years after the unveiling of Java, a language for programming computers which began as a tiny project within Sun that was nearly scuttled, it has created an awkward alliance between fierce rivals.\nWednesday's proceedings, to be witnessed by thousands of computer developers in San Francisco, will not be without controversy.\nDown the hall from where Sun Chairman and CEO Scott McNeally and other Java luminaries will be giving keynote addresses, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Bill Gates is due to showcase Microsoft's own implementations of Java.\n\"Certainly the center of the nuclear attack is going to be right here at ground zero in San Francisco,\" Gartner Group analyst David Smith said of the duelling keynotes.  \nThe pre-conference hype in the industry over the JavaOne conference reached such grand proportions that San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown issued a proclamation designating this week as \"Java Week\" in the city.\nAnalysts see Java -- which promises to enable programmers to write one piece of software that can run across all computer systems -- as a technology that will eventually creep into pretty much every company's systems.\nSun hopes that by de-emphasizing individual platforms, especially Microsoft's Windows operating systems which are themselves nearly ubiquitous on business and home PCs, it can level the playing field and extend sales of systems like its Solaris Unix platform, analysts said.\nInternational Business Machines Corp. and virtually every other major computer systems maker, including PC industry giants Microsoft and Intel Corp., have clambered aboard the Java bandwagon.\nBut Gates, who is not used to playing second fiddle, and other industry players over time are expected to vie with Sun for leadership of the growing number of developers entranced with Java, now estimated at 400,000.\n","103":"Internet start-up companies continue to plunge into a fiercely competitive, still-embryonic market -- but major investors expect an equally fast shake-out in the next few months.\nInternet security, Internet-based telephone service and Web publishing were among the vibrant but increasingly crowded sectors for new products and services from more than 60 companies demonstrating their wares at an industry conference in San Diego.\n\"There are a lot of things here that are products, not companies,\" said Thomas Winter, general partner at Onset Ventures in Austin, Texas, after viewing demonstrations at the three-day Upside\/David Coursey Internet Showcase.\nWhat separates the Internet market from previous start-up investment booms like personal computers and biotechnology, venture capitalists say, is the potential market opportunity is expected to be far broader.\nJohn Doerr, the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers venture capital guru often hailed as someone who starts whole industries rather than just companies, calculates the Internet venture market is taking off at three times the velocity of the PC industry 15 years ago.\nYet the speed also means sectors of the Internet industry have gone through consolidation phases far more rapidly than more mature industries.\nJust a year ago, four Internet search and navigation companies were hitting the public market. But, shortly after that, merger activity began swiftly for other, non-public navigation services.\nSome industry executives and venture investors are already seeing a similar phenomenon in other areas. With the cool state of the market for initial public offerings, many companies are expected to seek corporate investment or buyouts.\nMany have shifted their business plans to the corporate market in an effort to win corporate information technology dollars. Partly, this is also due to a view that public Internet access will not speed up any time soon.\n\"There's no panacea in the bandwidth area,\" said Intel Corp. executive Victor Varney, using the industry term for the speed of an Internet connection. Varney noted that an independent survey projects that by the year 2000 fewer than 20 percent of individuals will have speedier connections than a common phone line.\nOne example of overcrowding in an Internet business sector is the category of \"push computing\" where more than two dozen companies are competing, including Net software heavyweights Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp.\nMany industry executives expect Microsoft and Netscape will turn push technology -- the automatic delivery of customized information over the Internet to computer users -- into a commodity market, leaving room for only a few providers.\nVenture capitalists see this as an example of a broader shake-out in the Internet business.\n\"I think we're still deeply into the settling-out period,\" Onset Venture's Winter said.\n\"Is push going to be a business? It may turn out to be a technology like AI (artificial intelligence),\" rather than a full-blown business, he said.\nThe pace of the initial public offering (IPO) market for Internet start-ups was at its most frantic last spring when some companies gained $1 billion initial market valuations despite little promise of sustainable profits.\nAt the time, investment bankers joked you could write \"Internet\" on a dollar bill and they could take it public for $10, but no longer.\n\"Within six months 'Internet' is going to be a nasty word to use in an IPO. I predict no company going public will want to be an Internet company by then,\" said one industry executive.\nNevertheless, major companies like microprocessor maker Intel are seeking to drive adoption of Internet technologies forward and to encourage continued entrepreneurial investment, partly to ensure the continued growth of their own businesses.\n\"We don't think there has been enough thinking through of new content capabilities of the Internet,\" said Varney, who predicts one day there will be \"a much more aggressive integration of the Internet than we see today.\"\n","104":"A fast-selling product that allows grannies all across America to exchange electronic mail securely with their families may become a key weapon in challenging the U.S. government's tight encryption policies.\nComputer industry executives said the strong encryption which startup USWeb Networks is delivering on hundreds of thousands of television-based Internet browsing devices is still prohibited from export by U.S. Cold War munitions laws.\nExecutives at Palo Alto, Calif.-based WebTV said they chose to use the strongest coding standard available to give consumers the assurance their communications would be kept confidential.\n\"The only way we felt we could guarantee the level of security we felt was uncrackable by anyone...was if we were essentially using CIA-class security procedures,\" said Steve Perlman, co-founder and chief executive of WebTV Networks.\nWebTV uses 128-bit encryption, based on coded 'keys' with 128 characters of information, the same level of coding used in some of the most secretive U.S. government communications.\n\"It's very similar to what they use when they're communicating with cruise missiles,\" Perlman said.\nThis is a useful fact to point out in reassuring potential customers they can both communicate and pay for goods and services securely over the Internet, he added.\n\"They love it. They really love it, beause now they can just relax and forget about it,\" he said. Using a credit card number over WebTV's encrypted communications is safer than reading it over a telephone, which can be tapped, he argues.\n\"While the FBI can get your credit card that way (over the telephone), they can't get it through WebTV,\" he said.\nPerhaps equally excited about the decision by WebTV to use such strong encryption is the Silicon Valley high tech business community, which has been deadlocked in a battle with the Clinton administration over encryption restrictions.\nLaws against the export of encryption date back to the start of the Cold War, when earlier versions of coding were considered vital to national security and were classified as munitions explicitly barred from export.\nTop computer executives now say the use of encryption in relatively normal, consumer-oriented applications such as WebTV is a perfect example why they feel the government's efforts to restrict the technology should ultimately fail.\n\"Without commenting specifically on WebTV, I can tell you that the government is fighting essentially a losing battle here,\" said Eric Schmidt, chief technology officer at Sun Microsystems Inc.\n\"What's happened is that the technology is now so ubiquitous and there are so many people using it that the current law...really needs to be scrapped.\"\nIn addition to the need for U.S. businesses to have strong encryption to secure their own systems when operating overseas, the computer industry argues that competitors in other countries are being given an open market to sell higher levels of encryption U.S. companies are barred from selling.\nBut Washington insists that law enforcement authorities must have a means of breaking into encoded messages to investigate criminal activity.\nThe Administration recently offered a compromise where companies could export modestly strong 'keys,' less powerful than those used by WebTV, as long as they could be recovered by authorities to crack codes after obtaining a court warrant.\nIndustry is not pleased with the idea.\nIt would be difficult, and unduly expensive, to administer and is unlikely to be acceptable to foreign customers who might not consider the U.S. government to have a right to break into their confidential communications, many argue.\n\"Our personal view is that the notion of key recovery is something that's not going to be very acceptable, particularly to other countries -- the notion that the U.S. government would be able to recover the keys,\" said Deborah Triant, chief executive of Check Point Software Technologies, Inc.\nIn the meantime, however, WebTV will be prohibited except by special license from exporting its devices, which are being sold by consumer electronics manufacturers Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics NV through retail stores.\nIn fact, the issue came to light publicly following a letter from one of the manufacturers to its distributors, warning not to export the machines due to the munitions laws.\n\"It would definitely be unfortunate if sombedy was to carry one over the border,\" said Perlman, adding the WebTV boxes have more computing power than the world's most powerful supercomputer -- Cray Reasearch's XMP-48 -- did in 1987.\n\"That was a $50 million computer in 1987. This is a $300 computer and it outperforms the Cray,\" he said.\nWebTV has attracted investments from Microsoft Corp. and a unit of US West Inc..\n\"This WebTV is the first of many we're going to see where legitimate customers really do need very strong encryption for things involving really normal day-to-day use,\" said Schmidt.\n","105":"Netscape Communications Corp. stock was battered for the second time in less than a week on Tuesday following cautionary comments by a Wall Street analyst regarding the Internet software company.\nMerrill Lynch analyst Bruce Smith said in a research note that Netscape had scrambled to make its fourth-quarter goals in a way that could hurt its current first quarter and the outlook for all of 1997.\nNetscape stock tumbled more than 10 percent, dropping $4.50 to $42.25 on the Nasdaq market on volume of more than 6.5 million shares. The stock was one of the most actively traded on the exchange.\nThe stock of the Mountain View, Calif.-based company has lost more than a quarter of its value since the end of 1996, including a drop of around 19 percent after another analysts' warning last Wednesday.\nSmith said he remained neutral on the stock but cited industry sources as saying Netscape had scrambled to meet its fourth-quarter numbers at the end of 1996, which he said did not bode well for its current quarter and all of 1997.\n\"They closed a significant amount of business on Dec. 31 just to make the quarter, which they've never had to do before,\" he said. In his research note, Smith wrote, \"We have heard of two major deals that were closed on Dec. 31, one of which apparently closed late in the evening.\"\nBut a spokeswoman for Netscape rebutted this.\nSpeaking after the market closed, she said the company did complete some of its deals toward the end of the quarter, but she denied it was pushing down to the wire to lock up deals that would make a major impact on its financial results.\n\"We did no deals that were of materially significance on Dec. 31,\" she said.\n\"Sure, we did deals towards the end of the quarter, like everyone does,\" the spokeswoman added.\nLast Wednesday, the stock tumbled after Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst William Gurley cut his rating on the stock to \"accumulate\" from \"buy\" and cited risks from its transition to a new business plan and new pricing.\nSeveral other analysts, including Goldman Sachs's Michael Parekh and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.'s Mary Meeker, have put \"buy\" or \"strong buy\" ratings on the stock, recognising near-term risks but remaining upbeat on the stock in the longer term.\n","106":"Hewlett-Packard Co. jumped solidly into the Microsoft Windows NT camp on Wednesday, saying it would \"aggressively integrate\" the operating system into its computers and spend tens of millions of dollars on joint strategies.\nHP Chairman and CEO Lewis Platt, appearing at a news conference with Microsoft Corp Chairman and CEO Bill Gates, said the companies would work together on a broad range of products and services aimed at reducing computing costs.  \nAt one time Hewlett-Packard dismissed Windows NT, designed for the servers that run computer networks. Platt said customer demand was behind the decision to embrace it.\n\"It's all built around input from our customers,\" he said in a news conference at HP's corporate headquarters in Palo Alto.\nSupport for Windows NT -- only one aspect of the collaboration announced by the companies -- corresponds to HP's plan to develop a new processor with Intel Corp capable of running both NT and Unix software.  \nHP's warming to Microsoft could cause some discomfort to the company's partners, especially Netscape Communications Corp, Microsoft's Internet arch-rival. HP forged an alliance last May with Netscape to help companies build Internet-based internal networks on Unix and NT systems, analysts said.\n\"Our strategic direction is to provide choices and interoperability between choices,\" said one HP executive, called on by Platt and other HP executives to answer a question on whether HP will continue to support Novell Inc.'s directory services, as announced last week.  \nHP executives have stressed that the company wants to stay clear of the battles raging between Microsoft and Silicon Valley companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc.\nBut David Tremblay, an analyst at Computer Intelligence\/ Infocorp, said the next year may bring confusion for HP's customers if, for example, its neutrality prevents HP from making firm recommendations on software suppliers.\nThe deal also strikes a blow for HP rival Digital Equipment Corp, which has worked with Microsoft on Windows NT for five years. Digital's speedy Alpha chip is the only 64-bit microprocessor that currently runs NT.  \n\"The strength of HP is really quite impressive,\" Gates said in response to a question about how the deal may affect Microsoft's alliance with Digital. \"We've got a lot of breadth here.\"\nThe demand for services and support for NT now exceeds what has been available on the market before the deal with HP, which has a wide array of reseller partners, Gates said.\n\"Digital's jumping up and down about NT, but they're not exactly blowing the doors off of it,\" one analyst said.  \nThe growth of Windows NT is building steam, according to Gates, who showed a slide in which sales of Windows NT Server licenses were approaching 250,000 in the fourth quarter of 1996, up from around 150,000 in the first quarter last year. \"HP is pragmatic, if nothing else,\" said Scott Miller, an analyst at Dataquest. But he cautioned that HP faced a challenge as it drew more technologgy from partners such as Intel and Microsoft, making it more difficult for the company to \"own the customer\" as closely as in the past.\n((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau +415 846 5400))\n","107":"Hewlett-Packard Co. Monday will raise the stakes in the fiercely-competitive and fast growing market for computer servers by launching new models that are more than double the speed of their predecessors.\nThe new HP 9000 line of servers, the machines at the heart of computer networks including the Internet, are based on H-P's latest PA-RISC 8000 microprocessor. The company claims that they easily outperform those of its rivals.\nThe widely-watch launch will put pressure on archrivals Sun Microsystems as well as competitors like International Business Machines Corp., Silicon Graphics Inc., and Digital Equipment Corp.\nThe introduction, which follows a sluggish transition to speedy PA-8000-based workstations in June, will give a boost to Hewlett-Packard at a time of ferocious growth in the market.\n\"It's growing in the 50-plus range a year,\" Carol Mills, worldwide general manager for HP's multibillion dollar Unix server business, said in an interview.\n\"The Internet is hot,\" she said, but added that new applications such as data warehousing -- enabling access to vast data storage facilities -- and using servers as an alternatives to mainframes are also key market opportunities.\nMills, who said the current shift to Internet-based technology presents \"not just a window of opportunity but the sliding glass door,\" estimates that the new markets alone will generate many billions of computer hardware revenue dollars.\nHP's three new server lines complete its transition to 64-bit microprocessors for Unix machines, and the company is due to deliver a 64-bit HP-UX Unix operating system next year.\nAt the core of its new offering are four models its mid-range K-Class family, available immediately and ranging in starting price from $52,200 to $77,200.\nH-P said the HP 9000 K-Class models -- described as the \"sweet spot\" in its lineup -- are designed for symmetric multiprocessing and can accomodate one to four PA-8000 chips.\nThe company said the highest performing K460 model had 85 percent better performance that Sun's Ultra Enterprise 3000, while outperforming Digital's 4100 5\/400 by 65 percent and had twice the performance of IBM's RS\/6000 J40.\nH-P also said a new high-end HP 9000 server, the T-Class Model T600 with symetrical multiprocessing as a mainframe alternative for such tasks as on-line transaction processing, will be available in the second calendar quarter of 1997.\nHP said it will also begin shipping two new models in its entry-level HP-9000 D-class in October. The D270, starting at $22,260 and the D370, priced at $25,250, are designed for worgroups and departments and for sale by resellers.\nAs a sign of the fierce pace of product advances in the market, analysts noted the new models more than double the performance of machines updated as recently as February 1996 for the K-Class and January of this yer for the C-Class.\nJean Bozman, an analyst at International Data Corp. said the updated HP 9000 models is \"a strong offering\" which would be a boost for existing customers and make it \"highly competitive\" with fast-charging Sun in the duel for number one.\nIDC's 1995 statistics show Hewlett-Packard had the lead in worldwide revenues from small- and medium-size servers at $3.4 billion, with Sun selling more than $1.8 billion worth.\nAcross all Unix systems, according to IDC, H-P had server and workstation revenues totalling $6.1 billion, compared with $5.6 billion for Sun Microsystems, which due to lower system cost had the overall lead on a unit shipment basis.\nThe approaching H-P launch prompted a preemptive strike from officials at Sun Microsystems, which closed its fiscal year-ending June quarter with record-level backlogs due to soaring orders for the Ultra machines it introduced in April.\n\"This is just a chip upgrade for a system they've had a long time,\" Anil Gadre, vice president of corporate marketing at Sun Microsystems, said of H-P's launch, dismissing the high performance ratings of what he termed \"a late life kicker.\"\n\"We could not be in a better position to compete with them and position ourselves to take share away from them,\" he said.\n","108":"Calendar third quarter returns for hotly-competitive Internet stocks will reflect the sacrifice of near-term profits for longer-term growth, analysts said.\nMany Internet startups are still fighting to build market share and are expected to continue posting quarterly losses.\n\"Everything's moving quickly, but people still have to digest the technology, and pay for it...sorting out the winners from the losers and the also rans,\" said Steve Harmon, senior investement analyst at Mecklermedia's iWORLD.  \nTypical of the scurry to capture market share by making targeted investments early is Yahoo!

Inc. to provide an Internet information navigation service.\nThat deal was among the factors that helped boost services to 25 percent of revenues from 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996.\nChief Financial Officer Peter Currie said services and the Web site were important financial contributors.\nThe earnings were released after the market close.\nNetscape shares had traded at less than a third of their 52-week intraday peak of $75.25 during Wednesday's session, but rallied to close up $2.50 at $27.50 in Nasdaq trade.\nThe stock remained steady in after-hours trade, trading in a band of $27.375 to $27.625.\n","110":"Microsoft Corp Chief Technology Officer Nathan Myhrvold said Tuesday that contributions to new products from its basic research arm prompted its decision to triple the size of the group.\n\"Research has made very material contributions, so much so that we have decided to triple it,\" Myhrvold said of the company's plans, announced previously, to triple the size of its research staff from 180 currently.\nMyhrvold told Reuters in an interview that every major Microsoft product line now includes features that began in its five-year-old research labs, including the grammar checker and help system in its new Office 97 products.\nMicrosoft has budgeted a whopping $2 billion for its research and development spending in its current fiscal year to June 30, 1997, although by far the lion's share of that goes towards product development and marketing.\nMicrosoft Research receives between one and two percent of the overall budget, or between $20 million and $40 million now, and Myhrvold said the company wants to increase this by a factor of three to about five percent.\nMyhrvold and Rick Rashid, vice president of Advanced Technology and Research at Microsoft, said Microsoft's commitment to basic research in proportion to its industry could soon surpass longer-standing laboratories, like Bell Labs, which is now part of Lucent Technologies.\nA major benefit of the research laboratories is the amount of research the company can weave into its intellectual property portfolio.\nOne example of research under way at Microsoft is speech recognition and synthesis.\nGordon Bell, an eminent computer scientist who works in Microsoft's San Francisco-based research group, noted in a talk to the Association for Computing Machinery here the technology has taken decades to develop.\nMyhrvold said effective speech applications are now still three to five years away, but added this can now be estimated based on evolutionary improvements on current research, rather than speculation over new breakthroughs.\nThe Microsoft technologist says he was concerned the overwhelming enthusiasm over the Internet could subside if expectations become too high, although he added most of the dramatic Internet innovations still lie in the future.\n\"There's going to be a wave that makes the current use of the World Wide Web pale in comparison,\" he added.\nMyhrvold added that software companies will continue to innovate and drive sales of hardware by producing software needing more powerful PCs.\nOne day, the process of technical innovation will also create machines to rival human intelligence, he added.\n\"It's pretty likely that we'll invent computers that are as smart as we are,\" he said.\n\"When you tell people that a machine might be smarter than they are, they get tremendously insecure and threatened,\" he noted. \"But my car is faster than I am and I don't feel threatened or jealous of my car.\"\n\t ((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400))\n","111":"Netcom On-Line Communication Services Inc has decided to shift its focus to higher-value business services in search of profits, leaving the consumer sector to others.\n\"We've been growing at dizzying rates, what we're saying is we're going to focus more on quality here -- quality of earnings, quality of service to subscribers,\" Netcom Chairman and Chief Executive David Garrison said in an interview.\nDespite the San Jose, Calif. company's blistering pace -- it has grown some sixfold in three years -- the sharper focus will allow it to target annualized growth in the 40-50 perent range and seek to attract customers to higher-value services.\nNetcom executives said they will release further details of their new pricing plans in February, but levels will be above its current $19.95 access fee, which it is scrapping.\n\"We are discontinuing a line we don't think is a good deal for our customer or a good deal for our shareholders and we will replace it with other products we will announce in February. They will be at higher price points,\" Garrison said.  \nThe new services may be aimed at providing higher quality access, which Garrison noted was a source of customer concern throughout the industry, and may also include offerings which bundle software tools or online Web-hosting services.\nMost consumer-oriented Internet access providers offer unlimited access to the global network for $19.95 a month -- a price that analysts say leaves little room to generate profits -- or to help offer differentiated products.\n\"There's so much attention around a service (at $19.95) that's getting more and more marginalized,\" Garrison said, adding he will leave Microsoft Corp America Online Inc and AT&amp;T Corp to wage battle over consumers.\n\"Seventy-five percent of our business is from people who say I want to use this as a productivity tool to help my business learn more, be faster, be more competitive,\" he said. \"I'm going to focus on that segment instead of the consumer.\"\nNetcom also said it expects to gain 20,000 to 30,000 new paying customers in the fourth quarter, bringing its total to about 580,000, a slower pace of growth than in the past.  \nNetcom On-Line Communication Services Inc earlier said it expects to report an unspecified profit in its current, fourth quarter domestic earnings before deducting interest expense, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA).\nThe figure tops what Wall Street analysts had projected. Netcom Chief Financial Officer Thomas Weatherford said the year-ago fourth quarter results for the company as a whole, including overseas operations, was an EBITDA loss of $2.4 million, the majority of which was domestic.\nNetcom has focussed on bringing its domestic business to profitability, while timing and extent of overseas investments make profitability of those regions hard to predict.\nWall Street consensus fourth quarter estimates had been for EBITDA for the whole company of negative $6.4 million, or an EBITDA loss of 55 cents a share, the company said.\n\"We have been told by analysts that they would expect that we would beat that, based on today's announcement,\" Garrison said. Analysts had previously expected EBITDA to turn positive in the first or second quarter of 1997.\nAccording to First Call, analysts' mean estimate for per share final results for the fourth quarter was $1.18 prior to Wednesdays announcement, which came after the market close.  \nNetcom had said after reporting third quarter results two months ago that it saw \"a great opportunity\" to sell to its customer base by enticing them by higher levels of service.\n","112":"Microsoft Corp Wednesday launched electronic commerce software and a wide array of partners aimed at enabling consumers and businesses to buy and sell products over the World Wide Web.\nAt the core of the announcement is Microsoft's Merchant Server, software which will enable businesses to set up electronic storefronts on the Internet, and a plan to build a new channel of service providers to help businesses do this.\nAnalysts said the strategy was similar to that successfully used by Novell Inc to sell networking software.\n\"We believe there will be explosive growth (in use of the Web for shopping),\" Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Gates said at a news conference unveiling the company's electronic commerce strategy.\nMicrosoft also revealed 40 companies that are in the process of building Merchant Server sites and Henry Vigil, general manager of electronic commerce services at Microsoft, said he expects 300 sites using the software by year-end.\nThe product competes with an array of prior offerings, including those of Netscape Communications Corp and Internet startup Open Market, as well as Oracle Corp and International Business Machines Corp.\nAs part of the deal, Microsoft and VeriFone Inc brought together financial institutions and payment processors to provide a secure Internet retailing and payment system.\nThe financial institutions involved include BankAmerica Corp, Wells Fargo &amp; Co, Citicorp's Citibank Card Acceptance Europe, First USA Paymenteck Inc , NOVUS Services and Royal Bank of Canada.\nMuch of the technology was made available to partners for testing in August and was developed by eShop, which Microsoft acquired in June, company officials said.\nIn addition to the infrastructure partners, Vigil said a key priority was \"trying to get this new channel built where we see a range of hosting service providers who are really going to be the ones who lease the T1 lines and run the servers on behalf of merchants who are not technologists.\"\nOne such company, Boca Raton, Fl.-based Internet Communication Network, Corp., has been in business less than a year and already has some 50 customer Web sites in operation, including one using the Merchant Server, according to David Finkelstein, president of ICA.\nJames Dee, a specialist New York City photographer, said he had chosen to go through a networking service and support firm using the Merchant Server product to start up a new gallery to sell original contemporary artwork on the Web.\nThe site was set up in less than a month, he said, and Sarala Dee said the cost of getting the cyberspace gallery under way would amount to some $30,000 to $40,000.\nBut analysts said the market still may take a long time to develop into the multi-billion dollar market some Internet enthusiasts project.\n\"As Gates said clearly this is a beginning market,\" said Kathey Hale, an analyst at Dataquest.\nGates cited Microsoft and industry estimates that the number of consumers on the World Wide Web would more than triple between now and the year 2000, to 48 million.\nThe number of businesses on the Web is projected to grow four-fold by the year 2000 to two million from 500,000 currently, Gates said.\nDavid Cuursey, who publishes the Coursey.com newsletter on the Internet, said estimates the minimum price for a decent store using the software is $100,000.\n\"The point of it is that for a lot of people setting up a virtual store it will be also as expensive to create and maintain as a real store,\" he said. \"You're not going to use this technology to take advantage of it for less than $100,000.\"\n","113":"Sun Microsystems Inc's newly launched Javastation network computer is its first machine to compete directly with low-end personal computers, but analysts aren't expecting runaway sales just yet.\n\"Maybe a couple of years from now it will begin competing with low-end PCs,\" said Evan Quinn, an analyst at International Data Corp, noting Sun's network computing strategy is tied to future expansion of its Java technology.\nAn entry-level NC will be available in December.  \nEarlier Tuesday, the Mountain View, Calif.-based provider of network computing products and powerful workstations, introduced the JavaStation, a scaled-down PC designed to access corporate networks and the Internet, with an entry price of $742.\nThe company said the entry-level model would contain eight megabytes of memory and will ship beginning in December. A fully configured system, which includes memory, a keyboard, a mouse and fourteen-inch monitor will ship for $995.  \nSun officials are hoping the device will appeal to corporate clients looking to cut their costs for upgrading and maintaining office PC's.\nHowever, given the entry of long-time NC doubter Microsoft Corp into the market with plans for a light version of its Windows operating system, the market will be hotly contested.\nInternational Business Machines Corp launched its first NC model last month.  \nRedwood City, Calif.-based Oracle Corp, which has been beating the drum for creating a new NC standard for 18 months, is leading a further effort to build network computers for broader markets.\n\"This is just beginning to heat up and could potentially start getting very interesting,\" one analyst said of the brewing slugfest between computer industry titans.\nSun Microsystems's machines are more highly targeted than many of its adversaries', however, and it has linked them together with a Java-centric model of future computing.  \nJava, a hot new technology introduced by Sun in May 1995 as a programming language initially, has since been expanded into a whole computing architecture for both hardware and software as Sun moved aggressively to proliferate its use.\nSun has licensed Java to the suppliers of nearly all major computer operating systems, including Microsoft and its popular Windows operating systems. One of Java's most compelling features is that it can be used across rival systems.  \nThis feature should enable software developers in the future to write one version of their software that could work on nearly all systems, known as \"write once, play anywhere.\"\nInitially, the market will be to replace very basic computer terminals, such as IBM's 3270 terminals or IBM AS\/400 midrange character-based terminals, in very simple, dedicated functions such as entering data into a company's network.\nInternational Data Corp projects there are \"a couple of million\" such terminals in use currently, and perhaps as many as 10 million personal computers used for such activities.  \nThe market for the NC is likely to build sales gradually, according to IDC, which expects a million to be sold around the world in 1997, still dwarfed by the tens of millions of personal computers sold annually.\nSome industry analysts have questioned whether the NC will ever really catch on, and many believe it will not do so for at least some 18 months or so, by which time Sun's partners should be producing microprocessors optimized for Java.\nEd Zander, president of Sun Microsystems Computer Company, said in an interview that Sun realistically expects acceptance to be a gradual process, but to lead to a new computing epoch.\n\"We worked long and hard about not just producing a cheap box, but (also addressing the question) 'How does that box work in a corporate environment?',\" he said. \"'How do you administer it? How do manage it? How do you develop it? How do you deploy it?'\"\nHe acknowledges Sun's approach produced a system that is \"markedly different\" from the NCs that Oracle and IBM are talking about, or even that of Microsoft's NetPC.\nSun is targeting cost savings, claiming large organizations can reduce the three-year cost of ownership using its Java systems to around $7,500, or as much as one fifth of three-year networkedPC costs projected at up to $36,000.\n--sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau, +1415 846 5400\n","114":"NEC Corp's NEC Computer Systems unit will on Monday launch a set of personal computers aimed at what it sees as a huge North American market of businesses with fewer than half a dozen employees.\nThe computers, which will include the first customized for this market to include Intel Corp Pentium Pro processors and a special software bundle from Microsoft Corp, are aimed at the needs of small businesses.  \nThey include APC uninterruptible power supplies,  Iomega Corp Zip drives for storing onto 100 megabyte floppy disks, NEC Multispin 8X CD-ROM drives, telephone headsets with built-in microphones and stereo speakers.\nThe four \"Ready Office\" models range in price from $2,199 to $2,999 and include processors ranging from the 133- or 166- megahertz Pentium to Intel's 180-megahertz Pentium Pro.\nThe target market, which NEC calls the \"Tiny Office\/Home Office\" (TOHO) segment, is a subset of the Small Office\/Home Office market targeted by many computer makers and includes a vast array of professionals and service businesses.  \nAccording to IDC\/LINK data, NEC said, this group accounts for around 56 percent of the businesses with fewer than 100 employees in the United States, referred to in the computer industry as the SOHO, or Small Office\/Home Office, market.\nFurthermore, NEC said in a white paper, the group will purchase 2.23 million computer units in 1996, or some 40 percent of all units sold into the SOHO market.\nAccountants, florists, doctors, graphic designers, real estate agents, writers, restaurants and travel agents are among the businesses NEC aims to address.  \nNEC's research found these one to five person businesses generally lack the corporate infrastructure found in larger operations, so often one personal computer-level machine must carry the weight of all the organization's activities.\n\"TOHO business owners require computing solutions that will not only auotomate business processes, but assist them in managing the business as well,\" Timothy Chin, NEC Computer Systems senior product manager, wrote in a market report.  \n\"TOHO business owners need computing solutions that will help them to better wear each of their several hats, including those of president, chief financial officer, marketing professinal, MIS technician, business or legal advisory, even secretary,\" he said.\n\"In TOHO companies, the computer is the busineess -- without it core activities would come to a screeching halt.\"  \nSteffanee White, a product manager at NEC Computer Systems here, said in an interview that NEC had taken a \"bottom-up\" approach to designing its products for the TOHO market, stripping out unnecessary features like high-end audio and graphics or computer games and children's educational titles.\nThrough a partnership with Microsoft, NEC said it will be the first to include on its machine the combination of Windows 95 with a business software suite incorporating Word, Excel and Publisher 97 and special Excel and Word templates.  \nThe computers are also fitted with Peachtree First Accounting, Microsoft Schedule+, Money, Bookshelf and Automap Streets, in addition to voicemail, fax, e-mail and Novell Inc network certification, the company said.\nFor the reseller channel, the company will ship four roughly equivalent PowerMate Office models ranging in price from $2,100 to $3,200, with the high-end PowerMate Office Pro 2620 running the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 operating system.\nNEC said the products will be available by mid-October.\nSystem prices do not include monitors, it said.\n","115":"In the next half century, computers will be ubiquitous in the home, waking us up to cheerful songbirds, making the morning coffee, filling the bathtub and driving us to work, according to leading computer scientists.\nIn fact, advances in computer imaging and communications known as \"telepresence\" may eliminate the need to drive anywhere to hold business meetings and conferences, several scientists told the Association for Computing Machinery's 50th anniversary exposition and convention here.\nThe theme of the three-day convention in the heart of Silicon Valley was to predict the progress of computing in the year 2047, 50 years from now.\n\"People will expect that when you wake up in the morning, you should be able to talk to your house,\" said Vinton Cerf, the scientist often described as the \"father of the Internet.\"\nPervasive use of computer chips and smart electronic sensors will link everything from the refrigerator, which can be automatically locked to help a dieter's self discipline, to intelligent toilets, already available in Japan, that can analyse human waste to produce routine health reports, he said.\nThree leading scientists - former Digital Equipment Corp. researcher Gordon Bell, Hewlett-Packard Co. research head Joel Birnbaum, and Microsoft Corp. Chief Technology Officer Nathan Myhrvold -- predicted computers will rival human intelligence in the next half-century.\nA person could spend the first 40 years of life doing everything possible, then spend the rest of life reliving the sensations, Birnbaum speculated. Or one could chose to adapt the taste buds of a connoisseur.\nJust days after reports emerged from Scotland of the successful cloning of a sheep, an eclectic group of some of the world's most advanced thinkers in science, technology and the arts said biology may also hold keys to the future of the most advanced computing devices.\nFor example, Birnbaum described how synthetic DNA strands could theoretically be used one day to create biological computing devices in which the DNA contained in one test-tube could compute one billion billion operations at once.\nBirnbaum said it was difficult to know if this could be achieved in the next 50 years, but it was theoretically feasible. He said quantum computing, in which calculations are made using subatomic particles, and optical computing also were promising areas.\nMyhrvold said software development also could move towards software that could re-generate itself for new purposes.\nBut the experts also warned that eminent technologists in the past have also made very mistaken assumptions.\nBell noted that International Business Machines Corp.'s Thomas Watson, Sr., had predicted when the first general purpose computers were being designed in the mid-1940s that the world would need no more than five computers in total.\nDigital's founder, Ken Olsen, projected in 1977 there would never be a reason for using computers in the home.\nNow roughly one-third of U.S. households have personal computers and computing devices are used in devices from dish washers to automobiles.\nOn the other hand, many people thought voice recognition would advance far more quickly than it has.\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology professor Pattie Maes described how software agents can already be used at the MIT Media Lab to determine whether there's enough milk in the fridge or alert you if the value of your stock portfolio has plummeted.\nMaes described software agents under development like Kasbah, which will be available from MIT soon and buys or sells items such as personal computers electronically.\n\"The first 50 years was largely about hardware. My guess is the next 50 years is going to be about software,\" said John Sainson, general manager of International Business Machines Corp.'s applications solutions unit.\n((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400))\n","116":"Netscape Communications Corp., said Tuesday its quarterly revenues hit a record $100 million in the third quarter, demonstrating the surging popularity of its Internet software among companies setting up internal networks known as intranets.\nNetscape, which pioneered the popular Netscape Navigator browser software for cruising the Internet's World Wide Web, said its third quarter net income was $7.7 million, or 9 cents a share. A year ago, the fledgling company earned $175,000 on sales of $23.3 million.\n\"The third quarter of 1996 was another landmark quarter for Netscape, as Netscape server and client software solutions made significant inroads into the global enterprise market,\" said Netscape President and Chief Executive Jim Barksdale.\nWall Street, which had been expecting Netscape to report revenues of roughly $85 million to $90 million, had not expected the company to hit the $100 million quarterly revenue milestone until the second quarter next year, analysts said.\n\"I think the $100 million mark really shows significdant growth,\" said Hambrecht and Quist analyst Daniel Rimer, noting revenues grew 33 percent sequentially. \"This is major league revenue for a quarter.\"\nThe quarterly revenue was well above the $80.7 million it posted for the whole of 1995. For the first nine months, Netscape earned $12 million, or 14 cents a share, on sales of $231 million. A year earlier, the company lost $7 million, or 10 cents a share, on sales of $44 million.\nIn after-hours dealing, shares of Netscape were firm, changing hands as high as $44.875, up from its closing level of $44.50 in Nasdaq market trading.\nBarksdale said in an interview after the results that the indirect sales through third parties such as computer makers and systems integrators had accounted for 60 percent of overall sales, and 100 percent in Europe and Asia.\n\"We think it's a very efficient channel for us,\" he said. \"More and more we're seeing our job as demand creation through our direct sales force. We just think it's a more efficient way for these kind of products (to be sold).\"\n\"I'm very proud we have gotten to that as quickly, because we're very dependent on these people,\" he said.\nBarksdale outlined a broad range of companies which had chosen Netscape software to build applications for their computer networks, or \"intranet\" applications, and said the company was moving towards sales of complete systems.\nAnalysts said this focus and the rapid growth of the market will help it continue to grow in competition with rivals like Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines Corp's Lotus Development Corp.\nBarksdale said he remains concerned that competitors will be confused by the competitive frenzy, although he said key Netscape products remain lower in price those of Microsoft and Lotus, for example.\nBarksdale told analysts in a conference call that customers were using its Internet technology for a variety of functions, such as human resources administration, in addition to the order tracking feature for which it is known.\n\"What becomes clear is that people are not only deploying intranets, but they're expanding the utility of their intranets,\" Rimer said.\n","117":"For many computer owners, 1997 will be the year when Internet users will begin to see more features aimed at making the Net more lifelike. But it is also likely to be marked by frequent communications breakdowns caused, in part, by increased demand.\n\"I wrote a year ago about a collapse, but it's really collapses, getting more frequent, deeper and longer,\" said Robert Metcalfe, the inventor of the Ethernet computer networking technology and founder of 3Com Corp. who is now vice president of technology at International Data Group, of Boston, Massachusetts.\nMetcalfe said the congestion that causes many people to call the World Wide Web the \"World Wide Wait\" is only one of many problems that can prompt it to crash.\nMajor outages have been caused by such seemingly minor events as a rodent chewing a power cable or an ampersand typed in the wrong place in software on central Internet devices.\nOver the summer, more than six million customers of America Online Inc., the world's largest online computer service, were without service for 19 hours because of a software problem.\nIn October, a failure at Internet service provider BBN Corp.'s Stanford University Internet facility cut off access for 400 top high tech firms for nearly a day.\nMORE OUTAGES AS PROVIDERS TRY TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND\nExperts such as Metcalfe predict similar types of outages next year as telecommunications companies and Internet providers struggle to keep up with demand.\nStill, Web surfers are also likely to see many new features in 1997, from advanced graphics to slick ways to communicate with each other using animated characters in virtual chat rooms and high-tech games.\nDozens of companies, including the Germany-based Black Sun Interactive which recently opened an operation in San Francisco, have been developing new virtual worlds based on a technology called Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML).\nThe technology, pronounced \"ver-mul\", enables creators of multi-player computer games, for example, to design lifelike characters and three-dimensional settings that will exploit new 3-D computer chip designs and speeded-up microprocessors with added multimedia features due next year.\nNew capabilities include interactive, three-dimensional fly-over cities created by the startup Bigbook, which allows users to swoop down on a building and click on it with a mouse to see who the occupants are.\nSHOWDOWN OVER ONLINE PORN LIKELY\nBut as the Net becomes more lifelike, the prospects for a showdown between regulators and free-speech advocates over the issue of online pornography is likely to increase.\nIn October, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was investigating an electronic mail message sent to thousands of Internet users offering child pornography for sale.\nThe question of whether to regulate the content of the Internet, both within a country's borders and internationally, comes as officials in Washington are pressing for reductions in sexual and violent content in film and television.\nOne solution offered by some software firms is a device like television's V-chip, which allows parents to restrict access to certain programmes.\nNext year will also see new electronic communities in which people can participate as consumer, customer, contributor or even investor in enterprises over the Web.\nAlthough 1997 will not be the year people rush out to do all their shopping on line, it will be a critical year for deploying the technologies that will make electronic commerce widely available in 1998 and 1999, according to analysts.\nMichael Parekh, Internet analyst at Goldman Sachs, expects companies to continue using Internet technology both in internal networks, known as Intranets, and to create what are known as Extranets, to reach customers and suppliers.\n\"The big thing for 1997 is going to be the way users think of the Web goes from a pull paradigm to a push paradigm,\" he said, referring to the goal of being able to send data to individuals rather than waiting for them to seek it.\nIn the United States, only about one third of the country's 97 million households have a personal computer, and just 11 percent of U.S. households are estimated to have the modem devices necessary to link them to the Internet.\nFaster, 56-kilobit modems are due next year, but analysts expect a battle over standards will slow their spread.\n","118":"Intel Corp. will extend its reach into the networking equipment market Monday by launching two aggressively priced products aimed at speeding the use of increasingly powerful computers.\nIntel's Hillsboro, Ore.-based Internet and Communications Group (ICG) said it is introducing a networking hub to allow customers to move gradually from 10 megabits per second (Mbps) to 100 Mbps speeds.\nThe Intel Express 10\/100 Stackable Hub will be priced at $99 a port in some configurations -- a price it said was very competitive with traditional 100 Mbps hubs at $150 to $175 a port and the slower 10 Mbps hubs at $70 a port.\nIt can be stacked up to eight units high, allowing for denser packing of networking equipment than rival's hubs.\nIntel is also launching the industry's first single chip Fast Ethernet product -- dubbed the Intel 82558 -- to support networking at speeds of 10 or 100 Mbps.\n\"We want to make network connectivity a standard part of every PC shipped,\" said ICG vice president Mark Christensen, adding that the chip reduces the cost of building Fast Ethernet networking into PCs by about 50 percent.\nThe chip can be shipped directly on a personal computer's motherboard. Of the roughly 40 million new Ethernet-ready PCs shipped each year, less than 10 percent are done with motherboard implementations and Christensen said this could approach 30 to 40 percent of PCs.\nThe new chip will also improve manageability features, such as remote management of the PCs over a network to simplify maintenance and upgrades. Limited samples of the 82558 are now available for manufacturers, Intel said.\nThe move is Intel's second bold thrust this year in the fast-paced market dominated by Cisco Systems, 3Com Corp., and Bay Networks Inc..\nIn February Intel dropped its prices nearly 40 percent on Fast Ethernet network adapters - devices which can be installed in a computer to enable them to communicate in a network at higher speeds -- a strike most directly at 3Com.\n\"3Com responded very quickly,\" Dataquest analyst John Armstrong said of Intel's February price drop, \"When they modified their adapter pricing they really rocked 3Com.\"\n\"I don't think this announcement is at the same level,\" in terms of its direct impact on the current players, Armstrong said of Monday's introductions.\nNevertheless, Armstrong said Intel's aggressive price points could be a significant factor in accomplishing Intel's objective of boosting use of the technology.\n\"The fact they have 10\/100 isn't innovative - the price point is. It will reduce the indecision level,\" he added. \"Because Intel is coming up a bit later, they have to do things that make people stand up and notice.\"\n3Com is the leader in 100-megabit hubs, based on 1996 data, with its share on some products in the category up to the high 30 percent range. Bay Networks and Hewlett- Packard Co. are also strong in the market.\nIn the adapter market, analysts noted that 3Com has also provided advanced capabilities like the sort of network management features Intel is now making it possible to place directly on the PC motherboard.\n\"3Com is trying to outflank Cisco by coming at them from the desktop and in a way Intel is doing the same thing,\" Armstrong. 3Com has been facing greater pressure from both Intel and from Cisco, however.\nJust last week, 3Com said in its quarterly report that it could see slower revenue increases than the rest of the networking industry because of falling prices and weaker overall demand for networking gear.\nThe stock of 3Com has fallen sharply from the low $70 range early this year to below $30 last week. It closed down $2.75 on Friday at $29.25 on the Nasdaq market.\n\"Intel is certainly a contender now,\" in networking, said Armstrong, noting that in the networking hub market, for example, they were not in the top 10 industry players in 1996 but they could burst up the charts this year.\n\"They have indicated they certainly are not stopping with these most recent product announcements,\" he said.\nIntel said it was able to support the aggressive price levels due to its expertise in silicon design and fabrication and its volume manufacturing capabilities.\nThe company, the world's largest semiconductor maker, said its drive into networking, like many of its other recent industry initiatives, is aimed at selling more high powered personal computers that use its microprocessors.\n","119":"Hewlett-Packard Co. stock surged in heavy trading Wednesday, a day after the computer and printer maker reported surprisingly strong first-quarter profits that were its highest in eight years.\nMorgan Stanley &amp; Co., Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. upgraded their ratings on the company's stock and raised earnings estimates amid renewed confidence in the company's growth and cost management prospects.\nHewlett-Packard rose $7.375, or nearly 13 percent, to close at $56.875 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most active issue on volume of more than 9.1 million.\nThe stock traded as high as $57.50, just shy of its record high of $57.63 reached last spring.\nLate Tuesday, Hewlett-Packard reported profits of $912 million, or 87 cents a share, on revenues of $10.3 billion in its first quarter ended Jan. 31. In the year-ago period, it earned $790 million, or 75 cents a share, on revenues of $9.3 billion.\nAnalysts had expected earnings per share to be unchanged.\n\"Nearly all of the positive earnings surprise was driven by improved gross margins,\" NatWest Securities said in a report, echoing comments by other analysts citing Hewlett-Packard's strong asset management controls during the quarter.\nHeWlett-Packard said gross profit margins rose to 35 percent in its first quarter, up by more than 2 percentage points from 32.8 percent in the fourth quarter.\nHewlett-Packard Chief Financial Officer Bob Wayman said Hewlett-Packard pared inventories by 8 percent in its first quarter while revenues rose 11 percent to $10.3 billion, a sharp contrast to the prior year when inventories grow 54 percent, or twice as fast as its 27 percent revenue growth.\nAnalysts said they were cheered by the company's ability to trim its cost of sales across virtually all its businesses -- a process which company executives said would remain a key focus.\n\"That's why we and a number of other people consider them the best-managed company in the (computer industry) group,\" said John Jones, industry analyst at Salomon Brothers.\nJones said he had upgraded his earnings per share estimates by 6.6 percent to $3.25 from $3.05 for the fiscal year ending in September 1997, and by 4.3 percent to $3.65 from $3.50 for fiscal 1998 and reiterating the firm's \"buy\" rating on the stock.\n\"I think there's upside in their numbers, but at this point I'd like to see us get through the next quarter,\" Jones said. \"We've got one more tough comparison and then the numbers get a lot easier.\"\nHewlett-Packard fell short of expectations in the final two quarters of fiscal 1996 after two blockbuster quarters, and management cautioned analysts again Tuesday that its second quarter will be measured against 33 percent revenue growth a year ago.\n\"The exceptional growth that they had last year is really having a negative impact on them,\" Jones said. \"Right now, people are basically comfortable with this being a 15 to 18 percent growth company.\"\nNatWest also raised its 1997 and 1998 earnings estimates and continued to recommend accumulating Hewlett-Packard stock, which it said was very attractive at current levels and could reach $66 within in 12 months.\nGoldman Sachs, which had previously rated Hewlett-Packard's stock \"outperform,\" put it on the brokerage's recommended list and raised its 1997 earnings estimate to $3.25 from $3.00.\n","120":"Five major high tech giants, including Compact Disk inventors Philips Electronics NV and Sony Corp. will on Wednesday unveil details of a new \"CD-ReWriteable\" (CD-RW) technology.\nThe technology is due to bring re-recordable CD devices to the market in the early months of 1997 at prices below $1,000, and should begin being built into top-end computers next year.\nThe new format will enable users to store 450 times as much data, including video and audio recordings, as a 3.5 inch floppy diskette and is designed to be compatible with new CD-ROM readers and upcoming DVD-ROM drives.\n\"ReWritable removes the single biggest barrier to greater market acceptance of CD writing technology,\" said Dave Deane, Future CD Writer Product Manager at Hewlett-Packard Co.'s HWP. Colorado Memory Systems division in Loveland, Co.\nHewlett-Packard, Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. and Ricoh Co. Ltd. are the other companies unveiling the new technology, which has been 18 months in the works.\nAnalysts said the CD-ROM technology could eventually pressure other storage companies like Iomega Corp. whose revenues have soared on the popularity of its 100 megabyte Zip drives and other storage products, and struggling removeable hard drive maker SyQuest Technology Inc..\n\"I think this would put some pressure on SyQuest type products,\" said Ray Freeman, president of Freeman Associates Inc. a Santa Barbara market research firm.\n\"This is a higher-capacity product, so it's not going head-to-head,\" he said, noting that Compact Disks store up to 650 megabytes of data, a larger capacity than Iomega and SyQuest offer on their lower-end consumer-oriented models.\nBecause the new technology standard is designed to work with common CD-ROM readers and the new DVD-ROM technology, Freeman said its introduction was \"an important step in a continuum,\" following CD-Recordable, a technology on the market since 1991 that allows once-only recording.\nFreeman projects the CD-Recordable market will hit 1.3 million units this year, and the combined CD-Recordable and CD-ReWriteable market will more than double to 2.9 million units in 1997 and, combined with DVD systems, grow to 10.65 million in 2000.\nRob van Eijk, director of strategic marketing at Philips' Philips Laser Optics North America, in San Jose, Calif., said the new CD technology is aimed more at the space occupied by 100 million CD-ROMs than the floppy disk space.\nThe small office home office market and the high end home or small office markets are viewed as key markets for the technology as well, he added, saying the compatibility with other media made it a versatile technology.\nBoth Philips and Hewlett-Packard expect to offer devices in the first quarter of 1997 which would be under the $1,000 price point, but at a sizeable premium to the CD-Recordable write-once equipment now selling for as low as $499.\nHewlett-Packard's Deane said his company had reached the conclusion that without the new CD-ReWritable technology, \"the potential market would top out at a fairly low number.\"\n","121":"Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc plans this week to unveil a series of advances in its marketing of enhanced video and audio technologies.\nOn Monday, the company will launch a deal with Toshiba Corp's Toshiba America Information Systems unit to deliver what will be among the first DVD-ROM products to hit the retail market, Chief Executive Bill Schroeder said.\nDiamond will also announce new proprietary 3-D audio software and plans for moving into the market for machines running Microsoft Corp's Windows NT system.  \nOn Tuesday, the San Jose, Calif. maker of multimedia accelerators, modems and adapters also plans to launch a new plug-and-play video conferencing product, including a color camera and a microphone, at an estimated retail price of $399.\nAmid the flurry of introductions ahead of the annual Comdex computer industry trade show beginning November 17, Schroeder told Reuters in an interview the company is on track to increase revenues and margins in its current fourth quarter.\n","122":"Moving to capitalize on enormous growth in the use of laser departmental printers, Hewlett-Packard Co. on Monday will launch a new genre of printers it calls the \"mopier,\" to steal work from the copy machine.\nThe new device, dubbed the HP LaserJet 5Si Mopier, reduces the need to use copiers by allowing workers to make multiple original prints -- or \"mopies\" -- from their own desktop.\nHP, which is already a market leader in printers, faxsimile machines and scanners, hopes the new model will help it capture a share of the $18.5 billion a year copier market.\nAnalysts expect the printers will present a challenge to copy machine giant Xerox Corp. and other copier makers, as sales revenues of midrange, 20-30 pages per minute copiers is projected to drop by $300 million to $1 billion by 2000.\n\"Xerox is a dominant copier and printer vendor. This is a challenge and an opportunity for Xerox,\" said Robert Fennell, industry analyst at the market research firm Dataquest.\nThe market for midrange printers based on Canon Inc.'s 24-page per minute engine, until recently a relatively small segment of the market, is projected to surge by some 500 percent this year from 1995, he said.\nWith a U.S. list price of $9,549, the machine is more expensive than other departmental laser printers, but it contains more features and it is priced less than midrange copiers costing between $13,000 and $20,000.\nExecutives at Hewlett-Packard's LaserJet Solutions Group in Boise, Idaho, said the Mopier is part of its recently-unveiled Digital Workplace strategy aimed at addressing work flow and document management problems at work.\n\"Our customer research found that people are already mopying today,\" one of the executives said in an interview.\nThe new machine is based on HP's existing LaserJet 5Si models, but adds finishing tasks -- such as stapling and collating of documents.\nA user-friendly interface to help guide technologically-challenged workers through the printing options and tells them when their job is completed.\nThe Mopier is designed to cut down on the time office workers spend running between printers and copy machines, waiting for others to copy, and fixing paper jams.\nIt contains a 420 megabyte hard drive and reduces network traffic as well by storing each print task once and printing the number of copies specified, rather than requiring each print job to be sent down the network one at a time.\nCopies can be stored in mailbox bins until picked up.\nThe initial Mopier model may pave the way for a whole family in the future, if it lives up to its expectations.\nThe introduction is timed to take advantage of a major shift towards network printing -- International Data Corp. reported the number of pages printed on printers in 1995 for the first year exceeded those printed of photocopy machines.\n","123":"Intel Corp. President Andrew Grove said the $400 billion personal computer industry must serve up more than just television-like features to impress its most demanding customers: 10-year-old kids.\nIn an opening speech at the Comdex trade show in which he hailed the 25th anniversary of the microprocessor which Intel invented, Grove demonstrated how PCs with his company's next-generation microchips will be able to deliver full-screen video with theater-like, surround-sound stereo.\nBut, he said, this would only bring the PC to parity with the television as an entertainment device.\nThe industry must focus on satisfying \"our most demanding users: 10-year-old kids,\" he said.\nUsing Intel chips and graphics technology from Salt Lake City-based Evans &amp; Southerland Computer Co., Grove demonstrated how graphics could improve by the year 2000 to provide a more lifelike \"flythrough\" down a quiet English village street.\nDemonstrating Intel's renewed emphasis on increasing consumer use of products based on its chips and technologies, Grove said the entire industry needs to focus on satisfying customers with aggressive output of new products.\n\"My fear is that some day that (product) cycle might sputter,\" he told reporters after his address. The industry should aim to grow by 15 percent to 17 percent a year, as it has for the last decade or more, he said.\n\"Just as we are investing in technology for the long term, we need to target the new users of the future today.\"\nThis is particularly important as the cost of building a semiconductor plant has risen dramatically from $3 million in 1973 to $2.5 billion for its latest plant and will reach as much as $10 billion entering the next millennium.\nGrove said the industry must be prepared to meet consumers' expectations, including those formed over a half century during which the television defined visual experience.\n\"We are in competition for these consumers, for their dollars and their leisure time,\" he said, arguing that time especially was a \"finite\" commodity and computers needed to compete with TV for consumer share.\nGrove said there are only about one-third as many personal computers as TVs installed worldwide, even though the numbers of PCs sold annually is starting to outpace the number of new televisions sold on a worldwide basis.\n\"In this war, he who captures the most eyeballs wins,\" he said. \"In our battle for eyeballs, user experience on the PC must not only meet the expectation levels set by TV viewing, it must exceed them.\"\nGrove projected that microprocessors could by the year 2011 be capable of holding 1 billion transistors and deliver 100,000 million instructions per second, or MIPS.\nGrove said these advances are possible with current technology. Microprocessors are the semiconductors, invented by Intel engineers in 1971, which serve as the brains of personal computers.\n","124":"Even before the personal computer era's foremost figures donned togas and circus suits for the traditional extravaganzas of the industry's annual gala summit, industry titans were jockeying for the limelight.\nAlthough the 25th anniversary of the microprocessor is among the high points of this year's show, the next 25 years of the industry are likely to prove even more fast-paced, and bitterly competitive, according to senior executives.\nThe week promises a flurry of new products -- and whole new categories of products ranging from hand-held Windows PCs to new species of the controversial new Network Computer to fast new computer modems and the launch of DVD, digital video disk.\nThe latter technology holds many times the amount of data available on the conventional CD-ROM devices which now come as standard on many desktops, and is likely to appear next year on machines ranging from laptops to home theatre televisions.\nNot only will people be able to play full-length movies on their laptop devices, but the new medium is expected to unleash a whole new genre of computer games using sophisticated three dimensional animation and hot new 3-D computer chips.\nAlthough the annual event is prone to hyperbole -- and it is expected to draw nearly a quarter of a million executives, analysts, customers and media people this year -- some high- profile executives believe the time has finally arrived for the long-heralded convergence of television, computers and telecommunications into one vast, interconnected business.\n\"I think this convergence is starting to redefine itself as collision,\" Carl Wankowski, president and chief operating officer of Sony Electronics Inc., the U.S. operating unit of Sony Corp. told Reuters on the eve of the show.\nSony expects to showcase a variety of products, including DVD technologies and its WebTV set-top box, which turns a television into a simplified Internet browsing device.\nThe opening keynote of the week-long event will be Intel Corp. Chief Executive Andy Grove, who under the theme \"A Revolution in Progress,\" will trace the history of the microprocessor which turned Intel from a fledgling chip company into the world's largest semiconductor company.\nGrove will also provide live demonstrations of how personal computers can already be used for sophisticated applications today for complex graphics displays. He will outline goals and challenges facing the PC industry over the next 15 years, with projections for the next quarter century.\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Gates promises to issue a challenge to the industry in a keynote speech whose title harkens back to Gates' \"Information at Your Fingertips\" address here six years ago.\nGates, who recently republished his book, \"The Road Ahead,\" in paperback, has said the industry is too optimistic about what it can produce within a short, two-year time frame, but far too pessimistic about what can be achieved in a decade.\nNetscape Communications Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jim Barkesdale on Wednesday will make the third of a trio of keynotes that day, providing insight on how the pioneer of Web browsers sees competition moving to internal corporate networks based on Internet technology, known as intranets.\nBut the celebrations begin already on Sunday night, as International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development Corp. officially launches its SmartSuite 97 for Windows 95 and Windows NT at a lavish gathering to be followed by IBM's famous Toga Party.\nMicrosoft Corp. is due to unveil the Handheld PC (HPC) devices running its Windows CE consumer electronics version of its system at a Treasure Island Hotel bash complete with a Cirque du Soleil performance.\nA handful of major computer companies, including Compaq Computer Corp., NEC Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., are due to unveil mobile Windows CE-based handheld devices.\nOn Monday, Microsoft is due to show off the master version of its lastest productivity suite Office 97, enabling a direct comparison between its offering and Smartsuite 97.\nApple Computer Inc., still seeking to recover from huge losses over the last year, is expected to counter the Windows CE launch with more industry-focused adaptations of its three-year-old Newton handheld technology.\nThe company may also seize the opportunity to provide more details of its future technology plans, as rumours continue to swirl over discussions it has had with startup Be Inc., which has been working on a speedy new operating system.\n","125":"E*Trade Group Inc President and Chief Executive Christos Cotsakos said the company continues to increase its subscribers by eight to ten percent per month, with some days at higher rates.\nWe are growing between 8 and 10 percent a month, Cotsakos said in a presentation to investors at Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co's Tech 97 Agenda investment conference.\nE*Trade is fresh from its initial public offering in August 1996. The company's stock closed up 2-3\/4 at a record closing high of 22-1\/8, after reaching an all-time mark of 22-7\/8 earlier in the day.\nInvestors and analysts said a deal with Microsoft Corp in which E*Trade's share trading service will be integrated into Microsoft's online investment service, investor.com, had helped boost the shares.\nLike many of the companies presenting here, analysts see strong rationale for continued growth for specific companies like E*Trade as the Internet space expands and draws businesses onto the World Wide Web.\nThere's a lot of momentum behind them, Robertson Stephens &amp; Co analyst Catherine Baker, who covers Internet service and commerce sectors along with information companies, said of E*Trade.\nWhile the Palo Alto-based electronic brokerage company has been averaging 550 new accounts a day representing about $10 million in assets, Cotsakos said the company has had at least one day when it signed up 1,200 new customers with assets of $22 million.\nCotsakos noted that the company's percentage of total daily retail share trading volume had risen from 1\/10 of 1 percent in 1995 to 0.7 percent of daily volume.\nE*Trade processes some 7,000 daily transactions over the Internet, which represents approximately half its total volume, with telephone calls making up around a quarter of volume and the rest coming from direct dial modems and from gateways such as America Online.\nE*Trade earlier announced it had struck a deal with Microsoft Corp in which customers of Microsoft's Microsoft network MSN and its Microsoft Money product will be able to access E*Trade for trading.\nCotsakos said E*TradeFs customer assets have risen from $800 million two years ago to $3 billion currently, a compound annual growth rate of 208 percent.\nHe also noted that investors that sign up with E*Trade trade on average around 25 times a year, o roughly six times more than usual investors using a discount broker.\nCotsakos said E*Trade will be adding further news services as well as upgrading its telephone services with voice recognition technology. The company also plans to expand to Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Britain this year.\nCotsakos declined to discuss upcoming financial results. Baker said, however, that she estimates E*Trade's revenue could be $1 to $3 million ahead of projections in its current quarter, or 10-15 percent above expectations.\nBaker's estimate for the current, second fiscal quarter had been for the company to report $0.07 a share profit on revenues of $27 million.\nBaker said the upside surprise would track with currently strong market trading volumes, adding the company's growth would track well as long as the overall stock market continues to be strong, driving volumes up.\nThe analyst said the most important strategic move for E*Trade now would now be to add trading of mutual funds.\nNearly 400 companies are due to make presentations at the Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. technology conference in presentations spread over five days this week.

For instance, it would hold them liable if they made projections about future results and they turned out to be wrong.\nOpponents of the measure fear that corporate officers would stop making any projections about how their business was doing, making it more difficult to make investment decisions and leading to a decline in share prices.\nProponents argue it will help victims of fraud recover losses. Opponents charge it is an \"insidious\" bid by securities lawyers to line their own pockets.\nThere were signs the campaign against 211 could affect the outcome. A Los Angeles Times poll published Friday found 52 percent of likely voters now oppose it, up 10 percentage points from a similar Times poll five weeks ago.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt has urged California voters to reject the measure, warning it would use the state's legal system to roll back the federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act passed last year.\n\"California state courts could become a magnet for class action suits,\" he wrote in a letter of opposition.\nBoth President Bill Clinton and Republican presidential rival Bob Dole have come out against the measure and a recent study said its passage could result in a loss of up to 1.8 million jobs and a $102 billion drop in U.S. domestic output.\nThe study, by trade economist Clyde Prestowitz, also projected a subsequent rise in \"frivolous lawsuits\" could result in as much as a 24 percent drop in stock market prices.\nThis, he concluded, \"would far outweigh the 4 cents per dollar compensation, or less, that shareholders would receive from settlements and judgments\" under the measure.\nHigh-tech companies are considered more vulnerable to shareholder suits because their stocks typically are owned by demanding investors seeking fastest-growing companies, which can make their stock prices more volatile.\nA recent survey by the American Electronics Association of its members found nearly half would consider leaving the state if 211 passes. Some economists estimated it would eliminate 150,000 jobs and cost $1.3 billion in California alone.\nEven companies outside California, like International Business Machines Corp. and software giant Microsoft Corp. have opposed the measure, concerned that a single California shareholder could bring suit against them.\nIf it passes, high tech leaders like venture capitalist John Doerr, who is leading the $30 million-plus battle against 211, and Cypress Semiconductor Chief Executive T.J. Rodgers, have said they expect outside company directors to quit.\n\"If it passes, my net worth, my house, will be on the line,\" Rodgers said at a recent public debate on the issue here. \"It's a sleazy trick,\" he added.\nProponents of 211, including lawyers who bring shareholder lawsuits and stand to benefit directly from it, said they drew up the measure after a business-led initiative in the spring was opposed by nearly 60 percent of California voters.\n\"Americans are disgusted by corporate greed,\" said Richard Alexander, an attorney speaking in favor of the measure recently. \"People are angry about massive layoffs.\"\nBut in Northern California, where high tech businesses have thrived, executives said the proposition was more geared to forcing corporations to settle shareholder suits up front.\n","127":"Apple Computer Inc.'s chief scientist said the company is seeking to generate outside investment in its Newton computer group, especially for its hot eMate product.\nApple Chief Scientist Larry Tesler also told Reuters in an interview here late Thursday that Apple is looking to find new homes for at least a dozen technology projects it recently decided to stop funding.\nThe Newton unit was spared the ax in last month's restructuring, despite speculation it would be scrapped.\nIndeed, although early versions of the highly-touted Newton fell short of the mark four years ago, Tesler said Apple is getting rave reviews for its latest offerings.\nDemand for its eMate, a version of the Newton in a stylish clamshell case with a keyboard for schoolchildren and priced around $800, was particularly strong, he said.\nA small group of Apple executives have been charged with exploring alternatives to increase investment in the Newton business while the company is slashing spending elsewhere in a bid to return to profits, he said.\nTesler declined to talk about individual companies which Apple may have approached, and said he is not directly involved in the group's day-to-day efforts, but that they had entered the process with \"an open mind.\"\nThe group was prepared to consider a broad set of options, he said, although he would not say specifically whether these could include a joint venture or some sort of manufacturing or distribution deal, for example.\n\"We are pleased by the reception for the eMate and looking at how we can increase our investment in it at the same time as we lower expenses of the company,\" he said.\nApple's lead scientist said talk of scaling back or exiting the Newton business, which helped Apple pioneer the handheld computer market despite its bumpy start, was off target at a time when \"it's just hitting its stride.\"\nIn mid-March, Apple set out to cut spending by an average of 25 percent across the company while abandoning support for an array of technologies in its research labs.\nApple has said it would cut a total of 4,100 jobs and take a $155 million restructuring charge in the second quarter to the end of March. Apple is due to report its second quarter results on April 16.\nTesler said Apple was looking for ways to keep its discontinued work alive by licensing it, for example, to third parties \"so these technologies can come to market.\"\n\"They're not ones that fit our business model, but they're ones that we think are good and ought to come to market,\" he said. \"We have one or two dozen technologies that Apple has decided to discontinue and (it is seeking to farm them out) rather than seeing them wither.\"\nTesler declined to give details on what these further technologies were, other than the outline given last month in the company's restructuring announcement, and he said the method of seeking new sponsors to further develop and market the technologies would differ according to each.\nTesler was attending the Sixth International World Wide Web Conference in Santa Clara, where he gave a presentation to a crowded audience on some of the hottest new Internet technology for use on Apple systems.\nSpeculation that Apple might part with its Newton division re-emerged on Thursday after USA Today reported Apple was in talks with Sun Microsystems Inc. over the possibility Sun might buy the Newton unit.\nThe newspaper reported Sun could be a tough bargainer and said no deal was imminent. Neither Tesler, Apple nor a spokesman for Sun Microsystems would comment on the report. Sun said it does not comment on speculation.\nSun Chairman and CEO Scott McNealy said last week he would not comment on acquisition rumors, including those about Apple. He said that in general Sun will remain \"opportunistic\" in evaluating any deals that come its way.\nEarlier this year Advanced RISC Machines Ltd. (ARM), which makes the speedy processors used in the Newton eMate and Apple's recently launched MessagePad 2000, said ARM was working with Sun's Javasoft unit to make an operating system based on Java technology run on the ARM platform.\n((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400))\n","128":"Sun Microsystems Inc. and its heavyweight partners Wednesday launched a series of initiatives aimed at making its Java software perform more speedily on devices ranging from \"smart cards\" to supercomputers.\nThe announcements by Sun and Java partners like computer power International Business Machines Corp., software giant Microsoft Corp. and Web browser leader Netscape Communications Corp. came at the second annual JavaOne software developers' conference in San Francisco.\nAnalysts see Java -- a computer language which promises to enable programmers to write one piece of software that can run on many different systems -- as a technology that will eventually creep into pretty much every company's computers.\nSun said it would introduce a stronger Java for Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system this summer and would further enhance Java's performance and security by the end of the year.\nThe company, which before Java was best known for its computer workstations, said it also had devised Java variants optimized for devices ranging from large data center computers to smaller, hand-held machines and even pagers and cellular phones.\nOn the hardware side, Sun announced licensing and partnership agreements with companies like Japan's Toshiba Corp. which will put semiconductors designed around Java in a variety of devices from cellular phones to television set-top boxes, navigational devices known as global positioning systems and the aircraft electronics known as avionics.\nA previously announced version of Java software that will run on older personal computers using Microsoft DOS will be dubbed JavaPC and will be available this fall for less than $100 for machines using Intel 486 and Pentium microprocessors.\nThe company estimates JavaPC will offer new life to some 180 million such PCs.\nJava, unveiled just two years ago, has produced an awkward alliance among fiercely competitive rivals. Wednesday's proceedings at San Francisco's Moscone Center, which was packed by thousands of software developers, were highlighted by the usual industry controversy.\nDown the hall from where Sun Chief Executive Officer Scott McNeally and other major Java figures were giving keynote addresses, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Bill Gates was due to show off his company's Java work later in the day.\n\"Certainly, the center of the nuclear attack is going to be right here at ground zero in San Francisco,\" Gartner Group analyst David Smith said of the dueling speeches.\nSun hopes that by de-emphasizing individual platforms, especially Microsoft's Windows, it can level the playing field and extend sales of computer systems like its Solaris, which runs on the Unix operating system.\nGates, who is not used to playing second fiddle, and other industry players over time are expected to vie with Sun for leadership of the growing number of developers entranced by Java, now estimated at 400,000.\n","129":"The semiconductor industry said Monday its key indicator rose last month to the highest level in almost a year, reflecting a surge in new orders for computer chips.\nThe so-called book-to-bill ratio, which measures the value of new orders compared with shipments over a trailing three-month period, jumped to 1.10 in October from a revised 0.98 in September, marking the first time it has been over 1 since December 1995.\nThe index, widely regarded as a sign of the computer industry's health, means that manufacturers received $110 in new orders for every $100 in shipments.\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association said new chip orders in October rose 17.9 percent to $3.84 billion while shipments increased by 5 percent from the previous month to $3.39 billion.\nAnalysts said the surge was likely a one-time phenomenon as vendors sought to catch up with increasing demand after having pared back inventories sharply early in the year when prices of memory chips in particular were tumbling.\n\"These strong numbers for new orders in the Americas market should reinforce our industry's cautious optimism for a solid fourth quarter,\" said Douglas Andrey, director of Information Systems and Finance at the Securities Industry Association.\nAnalysts said they expect computer chip stocks, which had been firm ahead of the announcement on the expectation the ratio would rise modestly to somewhere between 0.99 and 1.03, to advance further following the upbeat data.\nShares of Intel Corp, the world's largest maker of semiconductors, surged as high as $124.69 in after-hours trade, 6 cents below its all-time trading high last week. Earlier, it closed up $1.625 at $123.875 on the Nasdaq market.\n\"I think it's an overall positive for stocks tomorrow,\" said Charles Boucher, semiconductor analyst at UBS Securities.\n\"The Street got possibly a little better than they were looking for, so I think you've got a chance to add on to this rally tomorrow,\" he said. \"The danger here is in investors getting too enthusiastic about the size of this number.\"\nSeparately, the trade group said it was planning to phase out the North American semiconductor index and replace it with a global index that would help industry watchers keep better track of demand for computer chips.\nThe industry group said it was making the change because the current figure only tracks sales and orders in the Americas, representing only a third of the total world market, and provided disproportionate data on certain chip sectors.\nWhile both industry and analysts have criticized the wide fluctuations and frequent revisions in the data -- even the September number was revised to 0.98 from 0.99 -- the move taken by industry consensus met with mixed reviews.\n\"I think it's a good idea,\" said Intel spokesman Howard High. \"The book-to-bill hasn't really reflected the true health of the industry, good or bad, for quite a while.\"\n\"As the business turned very global in its nature, the book-to-bill flash report was a U.S.-based number,\" he said. \"If you take it to the global market, it's really not done the job that people have been using it for.\"\nBut some analysts said the decision to drop aggregate bookings data altogether would only increase the amount of market uncertainty, as investors would have to rely on far more speculative estimates of new orders.\n\"I think it's going to blow up in their face,\" one top analyst said. \"It's going to be a lot more speculative. We're all going to be trying to do the analysis but we're going to be doing it based on our own independent surveys.\"\nKey semiconductor makers had argued, however, that bookings data was imprecise and subject to varying inventory strategies of distributors without any uniform reporting methods.\n","130":"In the true spirit of the lightning-fast world of the Internet, the browser wars which peaked in late summer have now been replaced by the battle for delivering content efficiently over the Web.\nThe coming months will see an intensifying battle between products that deliver information directly to a computer, rather than stumbling around looking for it with often lengthy and cumbersome Web addresses.\nThe competition centers on transforming the Internet from a \"pull\" model, in which people actively search the Web for information or use software agents to do that for them, to a \"push\" model, in which people can choose once what they want to be sent and it is published to them continuously.\n\"Everybody knows who they want to get information from. The real problem is: When is it that they have information that I care about?\" said Eli Barkat, chief executive of BackWeb Technologies, a San Jose, Calif.-based start-up.\n\"What people want is to build relationships,\" he said.\nVivek Ranadive, president of Reuters Holdings Plc's Tibco Inc. unit, likens the initial enthusiasm for surfing the Net to Sunday drives in the early days of the automobile, a pleasant but passing phenomenon.\nElectronic commerce over the Internet, which is expected to gather steam in 1997, requires a more efficient way of navigating the information superhighway, executives say.\nMore than a dozen companies, mostly small high-tech start-ups, have been busily seeking to define the space, much as search engines like Yahoo Inc., Infoseek Corp., Excite Inc. and Lycos Inc. have done in helping people search out what they want.\n\"As it was for search engines six months or a year ago, this is an area that has been more or less discovered by venture capitalists and others as something that has to be dealt with,\" said Jack Wilson, managing editor of Technologic Partners' ComputerLetter.\nIn addition to the impracticality of aiming to find real-time information in the more than 50 million Web pages that search engines catalog, many companies would like to be able to update customers and suppliers directly.\n\"There are some obvious problems with today's browse-and-pull technique for getting at information when you need it,\" Wilson said. \"So there is a proliferation of new companies and new products from old companies aimed at solving this.\"\nMore than a dozen companies are now vying for attention, including Ex Machina, which is providing a wireless news alerting system made by Global Village Communication Inc., and New York City-based Ifusion Com.\nSo far, the category has been dominated by one pioneering entry, Cupertino, Calif.-based PointCast Network, which burst onto the scene in the spring with a screen saver display which offers customized and updated news, data and advertising.\n\"The biggest application that's got the visibility with this type of technology is PointCast,\" said Phil White, chief executive of Informix Software Inc.. \"PointCast has got everybody now aware of how I can subscribe to things.\"\nAnother hot Silicon Valley start-up in the sector is Marimba Inc., founded by Kim Polese and three colleagues from the Sun Microsystems Inc. team which created the popular new Java programming language.\nIndustry executives say competition is vital to expanding the marketplace, but it also creates confusion as companies vie for a share of the action.\n\"I think there's a lot of confusion in the market,\" said Barkat. \"You hear a lot of names when people talk about this space, and the reason is the space is huge.\"\nTechnologies that transform the way information is delivered on the Web, such as those which Tibco Inc. will announce Monday, may help expand the market, according to industry analysts and executives.\n\"We are essentially a plumbing company, so we do plumbing software, and people like Marimba and BackWeb and PointCast can actually make use of our software,\" said Ranadive.\n\"Now the technology they presently use to do this is a pull technology and so you can emulate a push by going out and asking a lot of questions,\" he added. \"But you're tying up the network, you're tying up the server by doing that.\"\n","131":"Four publicly traded startup companies formed to help computer users surf the World Wide Web are now fighting it out in a battle that promises to circle the world at high speed.\nSince the flurry of their initial public offerings this spring, all four -- Yahoo! Inc., Excite Inc., Infoseek and Lycos Inc. -- have been busy trying to establish a beachhead on the Internet.\nAt issue is a solid shot at establishing leading brands for years to come for serving as the gateway to help people weave their way through the Internet's extensive, but still unruly, World Wide Web.\nThe stakes are high for establishing navigation hubs which could be \"the ultimate power brokers\" at the center of major traffic flows on the Internet, said John McCarthy, director of research for interactive technology strategies at Forrester Research.\nHe also said the fledgling companies need to offer more than the initial scattershot Web search approach he said was akin to \"a drive-by shooting.\"\n\"Users are getting more sophisticated and they need more than just pointers,\" he said.\nMcCarthy and others involved in the industry expect those who are successful in the next 12 to 18 months to attract even greater attention, and perhaps even acquisition offers, from the industry's largest players.\n\"Oracle, Microsoft and Netscape are not going to stand by and watch,\" McCarthy said.\nAll four of the newly public firms are developing and improving personal services by providing a sort of custom electronic front page on the Internet and most are looking overseas as well as to domestic deals to expand their reach.\nFor its part, Yahoo! -- started two years ago by two Stanford University graduate students -- has focused sharply on developing and extending its brand name, developing sites for three U.S. metropolitan areas and in Japan. Yahoo! also expects to launch country services for Britain, Germany and France in the next few weeks.\nAt an industry conference Monday, Yahoo Chief Executive Tim Koogle said the company was seeking to build on its lead in market share and advertising by spreading Yahoo's brand internationally and in a variety of services.\n\"You come to Yahoo! to find information and consume it,\" he said. \"The brand is important. Technology is important, too, but people don't want to have to care about that.\"\nWhile customers are most interested in ease of use, the companies have their eyes on the potentially billions of dollars in advertising that may find a home on the Internet.\nInfoseek President Robin Johnson, whose company has developed speedy new Ultra search technology, said there was upwards pressure on advertising rates, currently at around $21 per thousand views.\nExcite President George Bell, whose company launched a service this week using technology that updates a personalized service based on an individual's usage patterns, said ultra-customized services could one day produce highly-targeted ad rates of up to $200 per thousand views.\nKoogle said a projected $2.5 billion in Web advertising by the year 2000 -- some 1 percent to 2 percent of estimated total advertising spending, was not unreasonable.\nHow much of that will flow to navigation companies and their ability to continue to attract the eyes of computer users still remains a critical question.\nKoogle said a 20 percent to 30 percent share for the sector's ability to provide \"a share of eyeballs\" may be possible.\n","132":"A senior Clinton administration adviser said Friday electronic commerce over the Internet could become the world's largest trade category within the next decade if it did not become over-regulated.\nIra Magaziner, senior advisor to President Clinton for policy development, said in a keynote speech to an Internet Tax Policy Conference here the Internet must remain a free market for electronic commerce to take off.\n\"If we get the right kind of environment in place, we can accelerate this growth so that in a five- to 10-year time frame, trade across the Internet will actually be more than any other category of trade,\" he said. \"If we do it wrong, we could spend 30 to 40 years trying to undo bad policy.\"\nThe Clinton administration last month proposed a global electronic commerce framework and put forth a draft policy which proposes making cyberspace a duty-free zone, with no new taxes and minimal governmental regulation.\n\"One of the reasons we wanted to move quickly is we wanted to pre-empt what we saw as bad policy already being thought about,\" said Magaziner, who said he knows of a dozen countries contemplating slapping duties on the Internet.\nMagaziner, who organized the task force on health care which failed in its bid to introduce sweeping health care reforms in Clinton's first presidenctial term, said the White House wanted to be \"completely open\" in its developing its initiative.\nThe draft document is posted on the Internet at the White House home page (http:\/\/whitehouse.gov). The administration is collecting responses and hopes to issue a final version of the policy paper in March, the Clinton adviser said.\nMagaziner said intellectual property protection was a key issue, along with fair use, liability and privacy, and he said the government's policy towards encryption, which has been sharply criticized here in Silicon Valley, is still evolving.\n\"We want to preserve the Internet in its somewhat anarchic form...,\" he said of the White House position. \"The economic potential is tremendous, and what we in government must do is make sure we don't mess it up or interfere.\"\n","133":"Sun Microsystems Inc. said Monday it will move to build on the momentum behind its Java computer programming language despite overtures by Microsoft Corp. to co-opt Sun's initiative.\nThe president of Sun's JavaSoft unit, Alan Baratz, said the company will unveil several new initiatives at the second annual JavaOne software developers' conference in San Francisco later this week.\nAt the same time, some developers were buzzing with expectation that Microsoft on Wednesday may spell out its own plans for Java, including some which may not sit well with other Java licensees.\nAs the dominant supplier of operating systems for personal computers, Microsoft is among the more critical licensees of Java, which promises to operate across otherwise incompatible computing systems.\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Bill Gates is due to address a software developers conference in one hall of San Francisco's Moscone Center the same day JavaSoft unveils its latest initiatives in another part of the same convention center.\nMicrosoft would not comment Monday on its plans, but the showdown follows a months-long tug of war between the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant and Sun's JavaSoft unit.\nEarlier this year, Sun teamed up with International Business Machines Corp., Netscape Communications Corp. and Novell Inc. to launch a \"100 percent pure Java\" branding campaign aimed at ensuring Java retains its ability to work on multiple computer systems.\nThe initiative was designed to keep Microsoft -- or any other licensees -- from appropriating the technology, according to its proponents.\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, complained Sun had deliberately made a new Java version incompatible with recent releases of Microsoft's Windows.\nTwo weeks ago, JavaSoft applied to become a standards-setting body which could submit Java and its various upgrades to become standards under the auspices of the International Organization for Standardization.\nAt the time, a Microsoft executive complained Sun was not surrendering the Java branding and compliance process to the standards board, an action JavaSoft retorted would break with industry practice.\nMichael Kwatinetz, the lead analyst in Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's high technology group, said Microsoft's objective is to stay at the forefront of the software development community by continuing to extend its tools into the hot Java arena.\nIn an interview ahead of JavaOne, which starts Wednesday after a Tuesday gathering of Java licensees, Baratz said Sun was introducing a combination of new products and specifications aimed at the server computers used by large organizations for handling computer networks.\nHe also said that, as a separate intitiative, Sun will announce sharply scaled-down varieties of Java -- PersonalJava and EmbeddedJava -- which will be able to work on a variety of small devices.\nThese would bring Java to personal digital assistants such as Apple Computers Inc.'s Newton, copiers and even smart cards, as well as televisions, pagers and cellular phones, changing the definition of what a computer is, according to Javasoft executives.\n\"The momentum behind Java continues to grow,\" said Baratz, adding the JavaOne show is sold out with more than 9,000 developers registered and an estimated 400,000 developers now seriously using Java worldwide.\n","134":"Hewlett-Packard Co. said Friday that it will unveil technology Monday that will provide a breakthrough in the long-deadlocked debate over use of software encoding for secure data traffic.\nIf the encryption technology has won the backing of industry and the U.S. and other governments -- which Hewlett-Packard officials say is the case -- the development could eliminate a key obstacle to the growth of electronic commerce via the Internet.\nHewlett-Packard Chairman Lewis Platt will provide details on the technology, which includes technology patented by the Palo Alto computer giant as well as other technologies, a company spokesman said.\nTechnology from RSA Data Corp. the de facto standard-setter for Internet security, will be involved Hewlett-Packard officials said.\nHewlett-Packard stock closed up $1.375 at $50.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nSenior Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. executives were also scheduled to attend Monday's news briefing at the National Press Club in Washington, Hewlett-Packard officials said.\nThe technology will make it possible to export products containing so-called \"strong encryption,\" which cannot be exported under national security laws dating back to the Cold War.\nUnder national security law, the U.S. government has allowed the export of software and other computer products containing only weaker data encryption technologies.\nEncryption has been classified as a munition because of its potential for use by terrorists, spies or other criminals to conceal messages.\nEncryption programmes use mathematical formulas to scramble information, such as electronic mail messages or credit card numbers, to render them unreadable to computer users without a password or \"software key\" that can unlock the coded material.\nFor years the domestic computer industry has complained that such restrictions have hampered its competitiveness in world markets, and that its customers did not necessarily want the government to be able to decode internal data.\nThe industry says the laws have prevented it from offering some of the most recent Internet technologies, even within the United States, because it is impossible to prevent computer users outside U.S. borders from gaining access to technologies publicly available on the Internet.\nCompanies and their customers want to use encryption to protect confidential communications and electronic commerce.\nSilicon Valley executives recently noted that consumer devices, such as WebTV Network's Web browsing television device that hit store shelves this autumn, use the same levels of strong encryption as used in military systems.\nWebTV said it is using keys comprised of 128 bits, or characters, of data to encode and decode its communications to its set-top boxes to provide consumers with the best level of security available over the Internet.\nThe government recently proposed that the roadblock be eliminated by providing a key recovery system, in which authorities could recover keys to crack messages if they received a court warrant to do so.\nIndustry has rebuffed this as difficult to manage.\nThe solution being offered by Hewlett-Packard would be flexible, allowing customers to use the levels of encryption required by different governments, the company said.\n\"This is going to allow very strong encryption,\" said a spokeswoman.\nHewlett-Packard said its technology would provide a means of \"solving the data security and integrity issues that have impaired and frightened users and companies from exploiting the full power of the Internet.\"\nData Security Inc., the computer security pioneer acquired this year by Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. is also expected to be involved in Monday's announcement.\nRSA Data has become a de facto standard-setter for security over the Internet by licensing rights and technology to use its encryption systems. Hewlett-Packard declined to identify other companies or technology that may be involved.\n","135":"Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates on Tuesday swept aside doubts about the future of the personal computer, saying this type of computer system was going to be in the forefront for many years to come.\nThe Microsoft co-founder used his keynote address at the annual Comdex industry trade show in Las Vegas to illustrate how the PC had survived criticisms over its shortcomings and will continue to be used in a wide range of devices, from home computers to cellular phones.\nMicrosoft earlier this week unveiled the first line of handheld PC devices running on its new Windows CE operating system. Gates said Microsoft is working on advances that in 1997 should give its new high-end Windows NT programme the same sort of scalability -- the ability to add vast numbers of computing configurations -- as Windows CE.\nThese technologies, designed for high-end computers, are able to store terabytes, or 1 trillion bytes, of data to eventually process billions of transactions a day.\nGates said only around 15 companies now store terabytes of data and the billion-transaction level is more than phone companies, credit card firms or airlines currently process on such systems.\nBut, with transactions and communications using World Wide Web technology, the tetrabyte level is not far off, he said.\nTouting the virtues of the PC, Gates said, \"The strength of the PC is what you take for granted,\" he said. In recent years, for example, Microsoft and the industry have introduced features that allow PC users to easily plug in new devices and multimedia features such as video and audio.\nThe personal computer industry has grown dramatically, he said, with more than 200 million PC users worldwide. Although sales volume is approaching 70 million units a year, it will be hard to keep unit sales growth worldwide above the 10 percent figure in future years, Gates said.\n\"It's hard to grow at greater than 10 percent. There will probably be some years where you won't see any growth at all,\" he said, adding that, nonetheless, \"people are doing more and more with the PC.\"\nGates outlined an array of pending technologies, including three-dimensional graphics, and sophisticated methods of transmitting information to computers such as speech recognition and visual clues such as gestures or expressions.\nAt some point, he said, recipients of intelligent \"junk mail\" may actually be able to transmit their facial expressions upon reading it back to the organisation that sent the mail.\nIn future operating systems, Gates predicted that \"90 percent of the code will relate to these new input systems.\"\nGates, using videos to illustrate his point, poked fun at the Silicon Valley adversaries who are increasingly touting a new, low-price network computer, or NC, as the solution to escalating computing costs.\nOne of the videos depicted a variety of individuals being interviewed in New York City streets on their thoughts on a series of complex computer terms in a mock survey illustrating how little the public knows about computer technology.\nOne features Scott McNealy, the chief executive of Sun Microsystems Inc., who has been thumbing his nose at Microsoft and touting his Java technology and NCs as a means to eliminate Microsoft's lock on the industry.\nWithout being aware of what may have been asked, McNealy stares into the camera, and says, \"I'm not sure. I'm not a computer scientist. I majored in golf.\"\nIn a briefing following the speech, Gates and other Microsoft executives repeated that Microsoft was spending over $2 billion on research and development in fiscal 1997, and has budgeted $600 million in product support and $400 million toward partnerships.\nMicrosoft on Monday introduced the new Office 97 applications, which include word processing and spreadsheets, and said Tuesday that 1 million desktops users have signed up to receive it.\nOffice 97 software will cost around $199 for the standard edition and $299 for the professional product, similar to the prices of Microsoft's Office 95 versions.\n","136":"Hewlett-Packard Co., seeking to extend its position as a leader in electronic commerce, said Wednesday it agreed to acquire VeriFone Inc. in a stock swap worth $1.18 billion.\nHewlett-Packard said VeriFone, a leader in electronic payment hardware and software, will be operated as an independent unit of HP. Verifone stockholders will receive one HP share for each VeriFone share, the company said.\nThe acquisition is a big step in HP's drive to develop products for what it calls the \"on-ramps\" and \"off-ramps\" of the information superhighway, a business that includes computer printers and scanners, where Hewlett-Packard already has a dominant market share.\nIn an intervew last week the company's top Internet executive, Ira Goldstein, said Hewlett-Packard aimed to become the information appliance supplier to the fast-growing market for Internet technology.\nThe Internet portion of the electronic commerce market alone is expected to reach $95 billion in the United States by the year 2000, according to research by International Data Corp.\nHP said the proposed acquisition would combine its strength as the second-largest U.S.-based computer equipment company with VeriFone's leadership in electronic commerce. VeriFone had net revenue of $472 million in its 1996 fiscal year.\nThe acquisition price of about $1.18 billion was based on HP's closing stock price of $50.50 a share Tuesday. As of Monday, VeriFone had 23.3 million shares of common stock outstanding, the companies said.\nHP's stock slipped by $1 to $49.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.\nVerifone jumped $17.625, or 59 percent, to $47.75 in very heavy trading on the NYSE, after initially being halted, as investors priced in the value of the stock swap.\nRedwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone, which was founded in 1981 and pioneered automated credit card transaction systems, has recently expanded to include conducting business over the Internet and \"smart-card\" products for homes.\nSmart cards have imbedded computer chips that can store so-called electronic cash and other information.\nJust last week, Citicorp's Citibank launched a pilot programme with VeriFone to test smart card use that will allow selected customers to download funds onto smart cards using devices in the home or office.\nVeriFone estimates that its systems handled more than $520 billion of the $800 billion in electronic transactions conducted in the United States last year.\nHP said the two companies' technologies complement each other, with HP's focus on Internet security technologies and major corporate markets melding with VeriFone's expertise in moving money.\n\"Central to HP's strategy to achieve this vision is the ability to move money securely from end to end over the Internet, an area VeriFone has pioneered through products and strategic relationships,\" HP Executive Vice President Rick Belluzzo said.\nThe companies' relationship also includes providing products for the Visa\/MasterCard Secure Electronic Transaction protoco, which is beginning to roll out this year, for secure credit-card payments over the Internet.\n","137":"Moving to capitalise on enormous growth in the use of laser printers, Hewlett-Packard Co on Monday will launch a new genre of printers it calls the \"mopier\" to steal work from the copy machine.\nThe new device, dubbed the HP LaserJet 5Si Mopier, reduces the need to use copiers by allowing workers to make multiple original prints -- or \"mopies\" -- from their own desktop.\nHP, which is already a market leader in printers, faxsimile machines and scanners, hopes the new model will help it capture a share of the $18.5 billion a year copier market.\nAnalysts expect the printers will present a challenge to copy machine giant Xerox Corp and other copier makers, as sales revenues of mid-range 20-30 pages per minute copiers is projected to drop by $300 million to $1 billion by 2000.\n\"Xerox is a dominant copier and printer vendor. This is a challenge and an opportunity for Xerox,\" said Robert Fennell, industry analyst at the market research firm Dataquest.\nThe market for midrange printers based on Canon Inc's 24-page per minute engine, until recently a relatively small segment of the market, is projected to surge by some 500 percent this year from 1995, he said.\nWith a U.S. list price of $9,549, the machine is more expensive than other departmental laser printers, but it contains more features and it is priced less than midrange copiers costing between $13,000 and $20,000.\nExecutives at Hewlett-Packard's LaserJet Solutions Group in Boise, Idaho, said the Mopier is part of its recently-unveiled Digital Workplace strategy aimed at addressing work flow and document management problems at work.\n\"Our customer research found that people are already mopying today,\" one of the executives said in an interview.\nThe new machine is based on HP's existing LaserJet 5Si models, but adds finishing tasks -- such as stapling and collating of documents.\nA user-friendly interface to help guide workers through the printing options and tells them when their job is completed.\nThe Mopier is designed to cut down on the time office workers spend running between printers and copy machines, waiting for others to copy, and fixing paper jams.\nIt contains a 420 megabyte hard drive and reduces network traffic as well by storing each print task once and printing the number of copies specified, rather than requiring each print job to be sent down the network one at a time.\nThe initial Mopier model may pave the way for a whole family in the future, if it lives up to its expectations.\nThe introduction is timed to take advantage of a major shift towards network printing -- International Data Corp. reported the number of pages printed on printers in 1995 for the first year exceeded those printed of photocopy machines.\n","138":"U.S. high-tech venture fund investment soared 50 percent in the third quarter as overall U.S. venture investment rose 25 percent in the seasonally-slow period from year-ago levels, according to a survey released on Friday.\n\"It is so hot it's scary,\" Kirk Walden, who compiles the quarterly Price Waterhouse LLP National Venture Capital Survey, said in an interview.\nHigh-technology industries, from computer software and semiconductors to medical instruments, rose to $1.32 billion in the third quarter, accounting for two-thirds of the $2 billion invested during the period, the survey found.\nSoftware investments alone more than doubled from year-ago levels to $596 million, and in the first nine months of 1996 alone reached $1.74 billion, more than the $1.34 billion recorded for the sector in all of 1995.\nFor the first nine months of 1996, total venture-backed investments in the country reached $7 billion, nearly the $7.5 billion reported for the full year last year.\n\"Based on the current rate of venture capital investments, 1996 will certainly be another record year,\" Donald McGovern, chairman of the Price Waterhouse Technology Industry Group, said in a statement accompanying the results.\nThe third quarter total figure of $2 billion was a sequential drop from the blistering $2.8 billion pace the industry recorded in the second quarter.\n\"Third-quarter numbers are traditionally lower than second- quarter numbers because deal flow slows considerably in the summer months,\" said Carl Thoma, president of the National Venture Capital Association. \"But the venture capital industry still remains strong. Good deals are being made across the country in all industries.\nCompanies in the startup and early stages attracted the greatest level of venture capital investment, the study found, with these comprising 46 percent of the 444 companies receiving funds and accounting for $600 million invested.\nOn average startup companies received more than $3.1 million in funding and, communications firms accounted for nearly 56 percent of the total invested in this category.\nFunding for Internet-related companie continued at the high level set in the second quarter of 1996, with 62 Internet- related companies receiving funding in the quarter exeeding the year-ago period by six times.\nIn a new trend, third quarter venture investment activity appeared to expand beyond the traditionally dominant Silicon Valley and New England areas, whose combined share of investment fell to 33 percent of value invested.\nTypically the two regions account for some 40 to 45 percent of the total amount invested by venture funds, and experts said it confirms atriend towards more even distribution.\n\"Nobody in Silicon Valley is going to panic,\" because of the increase in funding outside the key areas, Walden said.\n","139":"@Home Network CEO Tom Jermoluk said the $48 million raised by the high-speed Internet service group allows it to be selective in the timing of an eventual initial public offering (IPO).\n\"We're not out seeking other forms of capital,\" Jermoluk said after the company announced the private placement in preferred stock, accounting for about 4.5 percent of the company and valuing it at a whopping $1.07 billion, nearly 20 times its initial value in 1995.\n\"We are a company that has been designed from the beginning to be one that does eventually go to the public market,\" he added, declining to discuss any specific schedule for when it might go public.\n\"The nice thing about now having raised this cash is we're flexible,\" he told Reuters in an interview after the funding announcement. \"Whenever the market and the company conditions are right together, then we'll be able to go.\"\nDespite the hefty valuation for @Home - more than double the $425 million Microsoft Corp agreed to pay for fledgling startup WebTV in its mostly stock deal last week -- @Home is heavily dependent on its partners to build out their cable networks to accommodate @Home.\nWhile WebTV has sought to gear its network to deliver Internet content at slow speeds over ordinary phone lines to a television set-top box of its design, @Home is aiming to provide speedy, high-bandwidth service from the start.\nTechnically, it can offer service at speeds more than 30 times faster than the currently-deployed dialup modems, but its seven cable operator partners will have to spend heavily upgrade their systems to accommodate @Home.\n\"Certainly hundreds of millions of dollars (are) required to upgrade all of their systems,\" he said.\nFor example, taking @Home partners' current rights to supply cable to some 45 million homes in North America, Jermoluk said $50 dollars a home would be a conservative investment requirement. This would be roughly $2.25 billion if every home were actually to be hooked up.\n\"That's a lot of dough over the next five or six years of doing upgrades,\" said Jermoluk, who estimated it would take that long \"to get a majority of those homes.\"\n@Home has already begun residential deployment in more than half a dozen citites, with each of its three primary investment partners.\n@Home's partners are not required to roll out an Internet service, but if they do, they have agreed it will be the @Home service. As a hedge, @Home has started a trial of Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) for use eventually by customers outside its partner's regions.\n\"In the areas where we don't have cable we ourselves will go in with an ADSL type of approach,\" he said, adding he will deploy ADSL selectively this year although he felt it is two years behind cable and modem prices are high.\n@Home, which is available for $35-$40 a month in a handful of areas, is also leading an @Work business for telecommuters and other business users priced around $150 a month for a direct link to an office machine.\nJermoluk said the commercial business will potentially become half of its revenue.\n\"It's a very attractive market,\" he said.\n@Home Network is also looking to expand outside North America, Jermoluk said.\n\"We've been in talks with a number of different countries,\" he added. \"I think the obvious targets are the big ones, like Japan, UK, Germany - the heavy population centers.\" (sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400)\n","140":"KLA Instruments Corp. and Tencor Instruments said Tuesday they will merge in a stock deal that would create a semiconductor capital equipment powerhouse with combined revenue exceeding $1 billion.\nAnalysts said the deal creates a powerhouse in the critical market for semiconductor capital equipment that can be used to closely monitor production and improve yields. This capability has become ever more important as the cost of computer chip-making plants soars into billions of dollars.\n\"This company in their particular segment of the equipment market is just invincible,\" said Gus Richard, Hambrecht and Quist semiconductor capital equipment analyst. \"KLA's been the dominant player and Tencor's been a very, very strong second.\"\nThe new company will be able to provide essentially one-stop shopping for chip process and diagnostics equipment.\nRichard said the combined product offerings will enable semiconductor manufacturers to augment incremental capacity by identifying and eliminating scrap earlier in the process.\nAt current prices, with a total of 85.6 million shares outstanding after the stock swap transaction, the deal is worth roughly $3.4 billion, or nearly 3.5 times revenues, which analysts said was a reasonable valuation.\nThe companies said the deal, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, will be accounted for as a pooling of interests and set up to qualify as a tax-free reorganization.\nUnder terms of the merger agreement, the companies said shares and options for KLA Instruments common stock will be exchanged for outstanding shares and options of Tencor on the basis of one KLA share for each Tencor share.\nThe combined company, which aims to provide the most comprehensive measurement and analysis systems for yield management available to the semiconductor industry, will employ more than 3,900 people worldwide.\nThe companies said the deal was expected to close during the quarter ending June 30, 1997.\nThe new company, to be called KLA-Tencor,  aims to combine complementary product lines to create a full-line supplier of yield management products and services. KLA is based in San Jose and Tencor in nearby Milpitas, Calif.\nThe merger comes as semiconductor equipment stocks have been rebounding from a cyclical downturn in mid-1996, when tumbling prices for memory chips due to sharply increased capacity and insufficient demand chilled the sector.\nKLA's stock hit a 52-week intraday high of $41.625 before closing at $40.875, up 87.5 cents on the day. Tencor also hit a year intraday high of $31.25 before before closing at $30.50, up 43.75 cents.\nThe merger was announced after the close of trading in the Nasdaq market.\nAfter hours, shares of Tencor were reported soaring as high as $37, while KLA fell as low as $39 on the news.\n\"It's one of the most rapidly-growing segments of the equipment market,\" Richard said. \"These two players are the dominant players in the market and what's amazing is their product offerings are almost completely complementary.\"\nAnalysts said executives of the companies told them in a conference call that their lawyers anticipate no regulatory obstacles, although the analysts said in some areas the companies control some 60 percent to 70 percent of certain markets.\nKLA Chairman Kenneth Levy will become chairman of KLA-Tencor, while Tencor Instruments Chairman, President and Chief Executive Jon Tompkins will be Chief Executive of the new combination, the companies said.\n","141":"Undeterred by recent market worries over the networking sector, Cisco Systems Inc chief executive John Chambers said he continued to see the industry's overall business growing at a brisk clip in 1997.\n\"We see a very good market at 30 to 50 percent growth for the forseeable future,\" Chambers told Reuters in an interview after a conference call with analysts in which he repeated Cisco's goal of outperforming the market's growth.\nCisco's second quarter results narrowly beat Wall Street estimates, rebuffing market talk on Tuesday of a shortfall.\nCisco reported that net income rose nearly 62 percent to $339.5 million in its second quarter to January 25 compared with $209.7 million a year earlier. Net sales rose 73 percent to $1.59 billion from $918.5 million a year earlier.\nAnalysts said Cisco's pro forma net income of $351.9 million, or $0.51 a share, excluding an acquisition-related writeoff and a net gain from sale of an investment, topped First Call's mean analysts estimate of $0.50 a share and roughly equalled Wall Street's $0.51-$0.52 \"whisper number.\"\nChambers said the firm expected to acquire another 10 to 12 companies in its current year. \"Almost every market segment has opportunity for internal products, joint development projects with our partners and acquisitions,\" he told Reuters.\nCisco shares, which had ended the Nasdaq market session down 1-1\/8 at 67-1\/8 before the results were released, slid as low as 64-1\/4 in after-market trade. Some analysts attributed the decline to concerns the company's post-exceptional $0.49 a share earnings number had fallen short of expectations.\nAnalysts said Cisco executives in their conference call had addressed concerns over a possible slowing in the market, sparked by comments attributed to rival 3Com Corp.\nSeveral analysts said they saw no sign that any December sluggishness observed by 3Com had a major impact on Cisco's business.\n\"I think it was another good solid quarter from Cisco. No hint of any problems,\" said Paul Saunders of Van Kasper &amp; Co.\nChambers said a shortening of order lead times -- down to one to three weeks now from eight to 12 weeks previously -- meant quarterly shifts in results may be more pronounced. He repeated previous comments that \"sometime in the future, we'll see a quarter that is in single-digit growth.\"\nAnalysts said sequential growth in revenues from one quarter to the next -- such as the second quarter's more than 10 percent rise from the first fiscal quarter -- would still provide sharp year-on-year increases.\nA second quarter gross margin of 65.3 percent surprised some analysts who had been expecting price competition to cut into margins. But Chambers said: \"Our overall guidance is over time...margins will continue to go down.\"\n\"There will be a few (quarters) up, but I think most of them will be down, hopefully just slightly.\"\nSmith Barney analyst Therese Murphy noted Cisco's third quarter tended to be weak, but saw no reason to be \"any more cautious than we normally would be in the April quarter.\"\nChambers did not see any fundamental industry change, and continued to target growth above the industry rate while taking advantage of further consolidation, she said.\n","142":"The Silicon Valley entrepreneur who founded Atari Corp. and created Chuck E. Cheese restaurants wants to put high-tech jukeboxes and video games linked to the Internet in bars, hotels and other public places -- and eventually make billions of dollars.\n\"Do you think 'Bubba' can surf the Net? I do,\" Nolan Bushnell told reporters at a news briefing Thursday in a wood-paneled room of his Woodside, Calif., mansion about 30 miles south of San Francisco.\nReporters got a look at three devices that will enable people to play video games with opponents in another location, order music as well as hear it and access the Internet with the drop of a coin or the swipe of a credit card.\nAristo International Corp. plans to roll the machines out worldwide early next month.\nBushnell, who is director of strategic planning for Aristo and has a minority stake in the New York-based company, said he and Aristo have invested more than $10 million to develop the machines, dubbed TeamNet, MusicNet Plus and TouchNet.\nThe company has gathered about 75 of the approximately 100 distributors of coin-operated games this week to unveil the machines and generate orders. Aristo wants to put the devices in sports bars, hotels, restaurants, airports and other public locations.\nThe TeamNet machine, which is the size of a small billiard table, allows two teams of up to eight players each to compete against each other or against teams elsewhere through an Internet connection.\nAristo said it is already seeking corporate sponsors for its tournament games.\nAnother product, TouchNet, allows people to use a compact, coin-operated countertop touch-screen computer to play games and send messages via the Net.\nThe U.S. market for coin-operated games alone has reached $6.8 billion a year, and studies for Aristo indicate this could grow to $20 billion, said Bushnell.\nBushnell, 53, is no stranger to video games. He founded the Atari video game company in 1972 and sold it in 1976. A year later, he opened the first of a chain of Chuck E. Cheese restaurants, which combine pizza with video games.\nThe MusicNet Plus product plays high-quality digital music and enables customers to buy recordings and merchandise from bands as well as tickets to events.\nAristo Chief Executive Mouli Cohen declined to say how much the machines would cost, but said hotel and club proprieters should expect a price that is competitive with current coin-operated vending machines, which generally sell for a few thousand dollars.\nCompany officials also declined to make sales projections.\nThe products are based on computers using high-speed Intel Corp. Pentium processors and use Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system.\nThe machines are being manufactured by vending machine maker Streak Technology Inc. and other California manufacturers. Cohen said Aristo was also in talks with Taiwanese computer maker Acer on manufacturing.\nCohen said in an interview at Bushnell's estate that Aristo has a development lead of at least six to eight months over would-be rivals.\nHe said the company has invested $15 million in cash and stock worth $10 million to build the company. The stock was unchanged at $7.50 Friday afternoon on Nasdaq.\nWith 13.5 million shares outstanding, Aristo is gearing up for a secondary offering of up to 2 million shares around October.\nCohen and Bushnell declined to discuss individual shareholder stakes, adding that Aristo has been working with investment bankers Allen &amp; Co. to evaluate potential strategic partners and investors.\n","143":"Hewlett-Packard Co. said it plans to introduce a photographic system for personal computer users capable of snapping, scanning and printing photography-quality images.\nThe company's new PhotoSmart line, aimed at the consumer digital photography which some industry experts expect to heat up this year, will not come cheaply, however.\nThe company's photo printer, scanner and digital camera can be purchased independently but together cost about $1,400, while new ink cartridges will cost roughly $40 each.\nAnd while any paper can be used in the printer, for best results HP recommends its own glossy and deluxe glossy photography paper, to be priced in the United States at up to $1.10 a page for the finest quality.\nA spokesman for HP said the products are initially aimed at photography enthusiasts.\nHP cited figures from the Photo Marketing Association which estimated that in 1995 some 710 million rolls of film were processed, or an estimated 2.5 billion pictures.\nAlthough the quality of consumer market digital cameras themselves is still well below that of conventional photography, HP's scanning device enables PC users to scan, edit and print images made with conventional photography as well.\nThe HP PhotoSmart products work with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 operating system and at least a 66- megahertz 486 processor, although Intel Corp.'s Pentium chips are recommended.\nBoth the printer and scanner, which will be available beginning in May, require a 2x-speed CD-ROM device, although a 4x-speed CD-ROM is recommended.\nThe printer, priced at about $500, requires at least 16 megabytes of random access memory (RAM) and 80 megabytes of hard disk storage, although double as much RAM and 120 megabytes of storage are recommended.\nHP's PhotoSmart scanner, priced at $500 in the U.S. market, requires eight megabytes of RAM, a SCSI card and 25 megabytes of hard disk space, although 16 megabytes of RAM and 50 megabytes of hard disk space are recommended.\nPhotography professionals said the difference between the output of the new HP devices and conventional photo printing methods can be detected by experts, but that the two are very similar in quality.\nHP's new inkjet printing system will enable people to print their pictures right away at home, although the results will not be instantaneous.\nAn eight-by-ten-inch picture takes an average five minutes to print and will take three to 20 minutes to dry, depending on the paper, print quality and humidity.\nHP has been working with companies to expand PC photography standards. Last week, it unveiled a new standard to promote browsing, distributing and printing high-resolution images over the Internet.\n","144":"For many computer owners, 1997 will be the year when Internet users will begin to see more features aimed at making the Net more lifelike. But it is also likely to be marked by frequent communications breakdowns caused, in part, by increased demand.\n\"I wrote a year ago about a collapse, but it's really collapses, getting more frequent, deeper and longer,\" said Robert Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet computer networking technology and founder of 3Com Corp who is now vice president of technology at International Data Group of Boston.\nMetcalfe said the congestion that causes many people to call the World Wide Web the \"World Wide Wait\" is only one of many problems that can prompt it to crash. Major outages have been caused by such seemingly minor events as a rodent chewing a power cable or an ampersand typed in the wrong place in software on central Internet devices.\nThis summer, more than 6 million customers of America Online Inc., the world's largest online computer service, were without service for 19 hours because of a software problem. In October, a failure at Internet service provider BBN Corp's Stanford University Internet facility cut off access for 400 top high tech firms for nearly a day.\nExperts such as Metcalfe predict similar types of outages next year as telecommunications companies and Internet providers struggle to keep up with demand. Still, Web surfers are likely to see many new features in 1997, from advanced graphics to slick ways to communicate with each other using animated characters in virtual chat rooms and high-tech games.\nDozens of companies, including Germany-based Black Sun Interactive, which recently opened an operation in San Francisco, have been developing new virtual worlds based on a technology called Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML).\nThe technology, pronounced \"ver-mul,\" enables creators of multi-player computer games, for example, to design lifelike characters and three-dimensional settings that will exploit new 3-D computer chip designs and speeded-up microprocessors with added multimedia features due next year. New capabilities include interactive three-dimensional fly-over cities created by the startup Bigbook, which allows users to swoop down on a building and click on it with a mouse to see who is inside.\nBut as the Net becomes more lifelike, the prospects for a showdown between regulators and free-speech advocates over the issue of online pornography is likely to increase. In October, the FBI said it was investigating an electronic mail message sent to thousands of Internet users offering child pornography for sale.\nThe question of whether to regulate the content of the Internet, both within a country's borders and internationally, comes as officials in Washington are pressing for reductions in sexual and violent content in film and television. One solution offered by some software firms is a device like television's V-chip, which allows parents to restrict access to certain programmes.\nNext year will also see new electronic communities in which people can participate as consumer, customer, contributor or even investor in enterprises over the Web.\nAlthough 1997 will not be the year people rush out to do all their shopping on line, it will be a critical year for deploying the technologies that will make electronic commerce widely available in 1998 and 1999, according to analysts.\nMichael Parekh, Internet analyst at Goldman Sachs, expects companies to continue using Internet technology both in internal networks, known as Intranets, and to create what are known as Extranets, to reach customers and suppliers.\n\"The big thing for 1997 is going to be the way users think of the Web goes from a pull paradigm to a push paradigm,\" he said, referring to the goal of being able to send data to individuals rather than waiting for them to seek it.\nIn the United States, only about one third of the country's 97 million households have a personal computer and just 11 percent of U.S. households are estimated to have the modem devices necessary to link them to the Internet.\nFaster, 56-kilobit modems are due next year, but analysts expect a battle over standards will slow their spread.\n","145":"Softbank Chief Executive Officer Masahoshi Son said the company will focus over the next year or two on growing its businesses organically and on preparing for the launch of JSkyB.  \n\"For the next couple of years -- a year or two -- we will focus more on growing what we have already acquired and also prepare for JSkyB launch. That's my focus,\" he told Reuters in an interview at the Comdex industry trade show here.\nSon also said the company has completed commitments to 51 Internet startup companies from its venture capital fund which totalled $350 million, including some $170 million from investment partners and the remainder from Softbank itself.\nSoftbank in the summer launched a 50-50 joint venture with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp in a digital satellite system known as Japan Sky Broadcasting, or JSkyB. The two in June acquired 21.4 percent of Asahi National Broadcasting of Japan.  \nThrough a string of bold investments, Softbank has become the world's largest computer-related magazine and book publisher and the largest producer of high tech exhibitions and trade shows. It is also Japan's largest computer software, peripherals and systems distributor.\nSon's comments mark at least a temporary halt to a buying spree which culminated in the purchase in September of an 80 percent stake in Kingston Technology Corp, a leading supplier of memory modules, for cash and stock worth some $1.5 billion.\nWithin the past year, Softbank closed on the $2.1 billion acquisition of Ziff-Davis Publishing, and last year it spent some $800 million for the Interface Group, whose trade show portfolio includes Comdex, the largest U.S. trade show.\n\"After the launch of JSkyB, and after we have good enough management infrastructure for the synergy that we create in the U.S., then we would do a lot more things,\" he said of the prospects for further major acquisitions.\nOn the venture funding front, Son said the 51 venture investments his company has led over the past nine months put it at the top ranks of recent Internet venture investment.  \n\"We became very quickly an important player in the venture capital market,\" he told Reuters, adding that Softbank was able to rely on assistance from its various operating firms.\n\"They helped in identifying the startup companies on the Internet, and identifying which one is the good one and the winning horses,\" he said.\nFurthermore he said startup companies, such as the branded Internet media company Yahoo! Inc, have been able to benefit operationally from Softbank as well as financially.\nSoftbank took a 35 percent stake in Yahoo! and established Yahoo! Japan, in which Softbank retained a 65 percent stake. This is just one of a series of rapid moves by Yahoo! which has extended its brand from its original role as a search engine to find information on the Internet.\n\"Yahoo Japan was established in February this year and started service April 1,\" Son said. \"Only two months, from scratch, and it has been profitable from the first month of operations and every month it is profitable.\"\nIn the Internet area, where many startups produce steady streams of red ink as they attempt to grow their business as rapidly as possible, Son said he considers the joint venture's profits to be somewhat of a record-breaking achievement.  \nYahoo Inc went public on the Nasdaq market in April.\nA little more than a dozen of the investments by the $350 million venture fund have yet to be completed, he said, and Softbank is likely to form an additional investment fund as early as next year. Son, however, declined to elaborate.\nInternet service companies, such as Yahoo!, and Internet content companies are likely to be the smallest but fastest growing opportunities for investment, he added.\nSoftbank recently reported first half pre-tax profit for the six months to the end of September rose 77 percent to $78.1 million as revenue grew 46.1 percent to $804.3 million, against a pre-tax profit of $43.9 million on $550.4 million of revenues for the year-earlier period.\nSon spoke after he and other senior Softbank executives made a presentation to media and industry analysts at a briefing at the annual Comdex show.\n-- sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau +1415 846 5400\n","146":"Intel Corp President and Chief Executive Andy Grove said on Monday that by the year 2011, microprocessors may be capable of holding one billion transistors and delivering 100,000 million instructions per second (MIPS).\nGrove, delivering the opening keynote address at the personal computer industry's Comdex trade show celebrating the 25th anniversary of the first microprocessor, said such advances were possible withing current technological know-how.\nMicroprocessors are the semiconductors, invented by Intel engineers in 1971, that serve as the brains of PCs.  \nGrove said that by 2011, the microprocessors the industry could be producting, given current understanding of the laws of physics, could run at 10 gigahertz, or four times the frequency of a microwave oven.\nThis is roughly 50 times the frequency of the current top-of-the-line microprocessors.\nSpeeds of 100,000 MIPS, a standard measure of computing power, would be 100,000 times the speed of Digital Equipment Corp's VAX 1180s, a line of refrigerator-size midrange computers popular in the 1980s.  \nIn a summary text of his speech issued in advance, Grove said the microprocessor of 1996 delivers 400 MIPS, running at a frequency of 200 megahertz (Mhz) with 5.5 million transistors. This, he noted, meets or exceeds a 1989 projection by Intel engineers of 100-MIPS machines at 150 Mhz.\nThe microprocessor of the year 2011 might fit on a die the size of a half dollar, or 1.8 inches, three times the current 0.6-inch die size, the Intel executive added.  \nThe line width resolution of computer microprocessors, which is critical to the ability to add transistors and power, may -- through projected improvements in photolithographic and process technology -- reach 0.07 micron, compared to 0.35 today.\nBut Grove also said the industry must be prepared to meet consumer expectations, including those formed over a half century by the medium of television.\n\"We are in competition for these consumers, for their dollars and their leisure time,\" he said in the summary text. \"That competition is the TV.\"\nHe said TVs outnumber PCs worldwide by about three to one.  \n\"In this war, he who captures the most eyeballs wins,\" he said. \"In our battle for eyeballs, user experience on the PC must not only meet the expectation levels set by TV viewing, it must exceed them.\"\nGrove provided demonstrations of the concept of visual computing, one comparing 1992 technology with state-of-the-art technology today, and another showing the high-end Pentium Pro Processor at current performance levels and simulating what will be available in the year 2000.\nIn his address, Grove demonstrated how Starbucks Inc uses connected personal computers to enable its chief executive, Howard Shultz, to communicate directly with the company's remote store locations.\n\"We need to be relentless in our concern and efforts to grow the number of users and uses of our technology as we are in our efforts to develop and build the technology,\" he said.\n\"Just as we are investing in technology for the long term, we need to target the new users of the future today.\"\n","147":"Hewlett-Packard Co., seeking to forge rapidly into the fast-growing area of electronic commerce, said Wednesday it agreed to acquire VeriFone Inc. in a stock swap worth $1.18 billion.\nHewlett-Packard said VeriFone, a leader in electronic payment hardware and software, will be operated as an independent unit of HP. Verifone stockholders will receive one HP share for each VeriFone share, the company said.\nForrester Research estimates the market for business to business electronic commerce will jump from $600 million last year to $66 billion in the year 2000, with consumer retail business rising to $7 billion from $530 million in 1996.\n\"When you talk about online commerce today, invariably you're talking about online payment. VeriFone is going to be the diamond in the crown in this area for some time to come,\" said Forrester Research analyst Karen Epper.\nHP said the proposed acquisition would combine its strength as the second-largest U.S.-based computer equipment company with VeriFone's leadership in electronic commerce. VeriFone had net revenue of $472 million in its 1996 fiscal year.\nThe acquisition price of about $1.18 billion was based on HP's closing stock price of $50.50 a share Tuesday. HP's stock slipped by $1 to $49.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.\nVerifone jumped $17.625, or 59 percent, to $47.75, also in heavy trading on the NYSE.\nJP Morgan analyst Daniel Kunstler said the deal provides HP with some \"lynchpin technologies\" for electronic commerce, and although it will be slightly dilutive to HP's current fiscal year earnings, the impact should be less than one percent.\nRedwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone, which was founded in 1981 and pioneered automated credit card transaction systems, has recently expanded to include conducting business over the Internet and using \"smart-card\" products for the home.\nSmart cards have imbedded computer chips that can store so-called electronic cash and other information.\nJust last week, Citicorp's Citibank said it will launch a pilot programme with VeriFone to test smart card use that will allow selected customers to download funds onto smart cards using its devices in their home or office.\nVeriFone estimates that its systems handled more than $520 billion of the $800 billion in electronic transactions conducted in the United States last year.\nThe acquisition is a further step in HP's drive to develop products for what it calls the \"on-ramps\" and \"off-ramps\" of the information superhighway, a business that includes computer printers and scanners, where HP is a dominant player already.\nHP said the two companies' technologies complement each other, with HP's focus on Internet security technologies and major corporate markets, including its broad distribution channels, melding with VeriFone's expertise in moving money.\n\"Central to HP's strategy to achieve this vision is the ability to move money securely from end to end over the Internet, an area VeriFone has pioneered through products and strategic relationships,\" HP Executive Vice President Rick Belluzzo said.\nThe companies' relationship includes providing products for the Visa\/MasterCard Secure Electronic Transaction protocol, which is being rolled out this year, for secure credit-card payments over the Internet.\nAnalysts noted that other firms, many of them fledgeling startups like Cybercash, in which VeriFone holds a 10 percent stake, are also competing in what they expect will be an explosive market for electronic commerce systems and services.\n","148":"Netcom On-Line Communications, Inc. on Monday unveiled a new multi-tier pricing policy, with price points ranging from $24.95 to thousands of dollars a month.\nNetcom said it would \"grandfather\", or maintain current customers, at the present $19.95 flat rate, but will introduce a \"fair usage\" policy which will over time limit these users from hogging bandwidth at peak hours, for example.  \nNetcom Chairman and CEO David Garrison told Reuters in an interview the company continues to grow very rapidly, and expects the pricing plan to boost revenues.\n\"Our company continues to grow very rapidly,\" he said ahead of the announcement. \"We think that (the new pricing plan) will result in increased revenues above where we would have gotten.\"\n\"We were operating profit positive in the fourth quarter in the United States operations and we would expect to continue that way,\" he said.  \nBut he added that \"We don't expect to see the full impact of this until the third and fourth quarter of this year.\"\nThe $24.95 a month Netcomplete Advantage service provides 28.8 kilobits per second access along with an extra mailbox, blocking software, financial and anti-virus software.\nNetcomplete Advantage Pro adds premium support and access to online research libraries for $29.95 a month.\nBoth services have a $25 set-up fee.  \nAmong its business services, which Garrison said could range up to monthly fees in the thousands of dollars, are new Web hosting services priced at $125 a month with a one-time $150 set-up fee.\nGarrison said the company was seeking to show \"leadership in a business that's sort of gone haywire.\"\nHe said the pricing plan was developed after collating responses from more than 25,000 subscribers. \"It was important that somebody lead the industry away from this craziness,\" he added.\nThe largest U.S. consumer online service, America Online Inc, raised a rage of protest and lawsuits after it announced a $19.95 a month flat fee Internet access plan and couldn't keep up with demand for access.\nGarrison said the company's research provided an answer of \"a resounding no\" to whether it could provide a \"successful business that is $19.95, has unlimited access, unlimited usage and quality service.\"\nGarrison said the Netcom plan is geared towards active Internet users who frequently combine the Internet usage with their business day and require access from work, home and on the road.

secure Internet retailing and payment system.\nThe financial institutions involved include BankAmerica Corp, Wells Fargo &amp; Co, Citicorp's Citibank Card Acceptance Europe, First USA Paymenteck Inc, NOVUS Services and Royal Bank of Canada.\nMuch of the technology was made available to partners for testing in August and was developed by eShop, which Microsoft acquired in June, company officials said.\nIn addition to the infrastructure partners, Vigil said a key priority was \"trying to get this new channel built where we see a range of hosting service providers who are really going to be the ones who lease the T1 lines and run the servers on behalf of merchants who are not technologists.\"\nOne such company, Boca Raton, Fl.-based Internet Communication Network, Corp., has been in business less than a year and already has some 50 customer Web sites in operation, including one using the Merchant Server, according to David Finkelstein, president of ICA.\nJames Dee, a specialist New York City photographer, said he had chosen to go through a networking service and support firm using the Merchant Server product to start up a new gallery to sell original contemporary artwork on the Web.\nThe site was set up in less than a month, he said, and Sarala Dee said the cost of getting the cyberspace gallery under way would amount to some $30,000 to $40,000.\nBut analysts said the market still may take a long time to develop into the multi-billion dollar market some Internet enthusiasts project.\n\"As Gates said clearly this is a beginning market,\" said Kathey Hale, an analyst at Dataquest.\nGates cited Microsoft and industry estimates that the number of consumers on the World Wide Web would more than triple between now and the year 2000, to 48 million.\nThe number of businesses on the Web is projected to grow four-fold by the year 2000 to two million from 500,000 currently, Gates said.\nDavid Cuursey, who publishes the Coursey.com newsletter on the Internet, said estimates the minimum price for a decent store using the software is $100,000.\n\"The point of it is that for a lot of people setting up a virtual store it will be also as expensive to create and maintain as a real store,\" he said. \"You're not going to use this technology to take advantage of it for less than $100,000.\"\n","150":"A few years ago, one company led the market for an exciting new technology called groupware, which enabled workers at different locations to use computers to collaborate on business projects.\nBut the rise of the Internet has changed all that, creating new opportunities for using such software more widely and setting the battleground for a clash for a share of one of the fastest-growing markets in the personal computer industry.\nThe market is driven by corporations' desire to use cheaper, easier-to-use Internet technologies to tie together far-flung and incompatible computing systems, a market some now estimate may reach $10 billion by the year 2000.\nThe trend has helped fuel the explosive growth of Netscape Communications Corp., which burst onto the public market in August 1995 and has been turning its focus to using Internet technologies in the lucrative corporate market for building the internal networks known as intranets.\nIntranets use relatively inexpensive software to link together people across an organisation and allow access to information via a common interface, or browser.\nNetscape's abrupt rise jolted software giant Microsoft Corp., which has been rushing to incorporate Internet technology throughout its products, and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development Corp., which pioneered the groupware market with its Lotus Notes products.\nAt Comdex, the computer industry's largest trade show, all three companies have unveiled strategies aimed at attracting major corporate customers to their products.\nLotus, which is trying to revive its early lead with its Domino computer network software and a package of collaborative programmes like spreadsheets and word processors, promises to use IBM's deep pockets to fund its campaign.\nThe battle next year is expected to be even more intense than the skirmish last summer between Microsoft and Netscape over Microsoft's entry into the Web browser market, in which Netscape retains a nearly 80 percent stake.\n\"If they thought the browser war was bloody, just wait,\" Lotus President Jeff Papows said earlier this week. \"This will be a whole new level of bloodiness.\"\nAlthough Lotus has moved to add Internet features while slashing prices on its software for the Notes market, the roughly $700 million in research and development spending it touts is only a fraction of Microsoft's $2 billion-plus total research and development budget in fiscal 1997 alone.\nAnd while Lotus officials privately say they would rather have the problem of reducing prices dramatically than having to build sophisticated corporate networke systems from scratch, new Internet technology offers compelling savings.\nNetscape Chief Executive Jim Barksdale, in his keynote address at Comdex on Wednesday, identified some corporate customers who he said had reported up to 2063 percent return on investment by deploying intranets using Netscape products.\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Bill Gates said his company will focus its resources on lowering the cost of corporate computing this year with the same intensity it applied last year in adapting Internet technologies.\nAnalysts said that by bundling many of its Internet-based technologies with its latest operating systems, Microsoft may have an upper hand in releasing new products and with customers who are committed to remaining on the leading edge.\nBut even in the personal computing market where Microsoft's operating systems dominate, fewer than one-third of company machines run the latest versions of Microsoft Windows software needed to fully utilize its groupware features, they add.\n\"It's less a competition for (software) suite sales than it is for corporate dollars,\" said Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. analyst Mary Meeker, who sees two paths for corporate customers.\nOne set may chose to upgrade all its software to the latest Microsoft products, including Microsoft's newly launched Office 97 suite.\nMeeker said this option is costly.\nAnother set of customers, Meeker said, could chose to keep their investment in existing computers and, using Netscape's products on the 17 different systems it supports, build a system combining these machines relatively quickly.\n","151":"In the true spirit of the lightning-fast world of the Internet, the browser wars which peaked in late summer have now been replaced by the battle for delivering content efficiently over the Web.\nThe coming months will see an intensifying battle between products that deliver information directly to a computer, rather than stumbling around looking for it with often lengthy and cumbersome Web addresses.\nThe competition centers on tranforming the Internet from a \"pull\" model, in which people actively search the Web for information or use software agents to do that for them, to a \"push\" model, in which people can choose once what they want to be sent and it is published to them continuously.\n\"Everybody knows who they want to get information from. The real problem is: When is it that they have information that I care about?\" said Eli Barkat, chief executive of BackWeb Technologies, a San Jose, Calif.-based start-up.\n\"What people want is to build relationships,\" he said.\nVivek Ranadive, president of Reuters Holdings Plc's Tibco Inc. unit, likens the initial enthusiasm for surfing the Net to Sunday drives in the early days of the automobile, a pleasant but passing phenomenon.\nElectronic commerce over the Internet, which is expected to gather steam in 1997, requires a more efficient way of navigating the information superhighway, executives say.\nMore than a dozen companies, mostly small high-tech start-ups, have been busily seeking to define the space, much as search engines like Yahoo Inc., Infoseek Corp., Excite Inc. and Lycos Inc. have done in helping people search out what they want.\n\"As it was for search engines six months or a year ago, this is an area that has been more or less discovered by venture capitalists and others as something that has to be dealt with,\" said Jack Wilson, managing editor of Technologic Partners' ComputerLetter.\nIn addition to the impracticality of aiming to find real-time information in the more than 50 million Web pages that search engines catalog, many companies would like to be able to update customers and suppliers directly.\n\"There are some obvious problems with today's browse-and-pull technique for getting at information when you need it,\" Wilson said. \"So there is a proliferation of new companies and new products from old companies aimed at solving this.\"\nMore than a dozen companies are now vying for attention, including Ex Machina, which is providing a wireless news alerting system made by Global Village Communication Inc., and New York City-based Ifusion Com.\nSo far, the category has been dominated by one pioneering entry, Cupertino, Calif.-based PointCast Network, which burst onto the scene in the spring with a screen saver display which offers customized and updated news, data and advertising.\n\"The biggest application that's got the visibility with this type of technology is PointCast,\" said Phil White, chief executive of Informix Software Inc.. \"PointCast has got everybody now aware of how I can subscribe to things.\"\nAnother hot Silicon Valley start-up in the sector is Marimba Inc., founded by Kim Polese and three colleagues from the Sun Microsystems Inc. team which created the popular new Java programming language.\nIndustry executives say competition is vital to expanding the marketplace, but it also creates confusion as companies vie for a share of the action.\n\"I think there's a lot of confusion in the market,\" said Barkat. \"You hear a lot of names when people talk about this space, and the reason is the space is huge.\"\nTechnologies that transform the way information is delivered on the Web, such as those which Tibco Inc. will announce Monday, may help expand the market, according to industry analysts and executives.\n\"We are essentially a plumbing company, so we do plumbing software, and people like Marimba and BackWeb and PointCast can actually make use of our software,\" said Ranadive.\n\"Now the technology they presently use to do this is a pull technology and so you can emulate a push by going out and asking a lot of questions,\" he added. \"But you're tying up the network, you're tying up the server by doing that.\"\n","152":"Sun Microsystems Inc. will Tuesday announce its entry into the supercomputing systems market long dominated by Cray Research, which was acquired by Silicon Graphics Inc. last year.\nSun executives said in interviews ahead of the Tuesday announcement that their new Sun Ultra HPC servers, or computers that manage the flow of data in a network, will offer better price performance than Silicon Graphic's Origin 2000 and International Business Machine Corp.'s RS6000 SP.\nIndustry analysts said the move could make Sun an aggressive new player in a market that has been changed over the last decade by new massively-parallel computers that use lots of small processors to work simultaneously on different parts of a problem in order to reach a solution more quickly.\n\"It's revolutionary for them,\" said Dataquest analyst Jerry Sheridan. \"It presents a competitive environment. SGI is a strong competitor in the technical arena.\"\nExecutives at Sun, which bought part of Cray's computing business from Silicon Graphics as part of the Silicon Graphics-Cray deal, said Tuesday's announcement was the first of a series of developments aimed at boosting Sun's share in the high performance computing market from virtually nothing last year.\nSun noted International Data Corp. projects the market for the world's most powerful computers, used for everything from nuclear weapons and environmental modelling to aerospace and automotive design, will hit $5.6 billion by 2000.\n\"We're leveraging into the markets where we've been traditionally successful -- that is the markets of the technical, engineering and scientific user,\" said Jamie Enns, manager of product marketing at Sun Microsystems Computer Co.\nSun's ultimate objective is to have a stake similar to the estimated 30 percent to 50 percent of the market now held by Silicon Graphics, he said. \"This is a five year programme.\"\nEnns said the core product is based on the Enterprise Server 3000 to ES 6000 line of products Sun introduced in April 1996 and adds supercomputing features. Sun said the U.S. list price for the systems will range from $43,745 to more than $2.5 million.\n","153":"Hewlett-Packard Co. is expected to extend its role as a leading supplier of computer printers next week by unveiling the first of a family of devices designed to allow people to bypass the copy machine.\nIndustry sources familiar with details of the new models said they can be used instead of a copier to make multiple printouts of a document, posing a threaten to copy machine makers such as Xerox Corp. and Canon Inc.\n\"This is the first direct attack at the copier market,\" said one of the sources, who declined to be identified. \"This is the announcement that is going to make Xerox begin to sweat.\"\nAnother of the sources said the initial adaption of the technology will likely be targeted for relatively modest printing jobs, three or four copies of a document, for example, rather than for dozens of hundred-page documents.\nA spokesman for Hewlett-Packard was not immediately available for comment on the new product, which one of the sources said could be unveiled as early as Monday.\nThe new \"Mopier\" machine, as Hewlett-Packard has dubbed it internally, is expected to be based on the LaserJet 5Si family and to come with a stapler, a multiple-slot stacker and secure, password-protected \"mailboxes\" into which printouts of confidential documents can be placed.\nIn a related announcement Wednesday, Hewlett-Packard said it planned to triple production of toner cartridges used in its LaserJet 5Si family of network printers \"to alleviate a temporary shortage of the cartridges in the United States.\"\nAnalysts said the move may have been partly motivated by the company's new multiple copy initiative, as cartridges for printers are an extremely profitable area of HP's printer strategy, and will be needed to supply the new machines.\nIn fact, Hewlett-Packard said Wednesday its own research shows that pages formerly duplicated on copiers are increasingly being printed on HP printers already, resulting in a greater demand for the cartridges.\nThe mopier can be expected to have similar performance to the LaserJet 5Si printers, which can print 24 pages a minute and cycle up to 100,000 pages a month, the sources said.\n\"With these new methods of business printing, HP estimates that customers are printing about 24 percent more pages a month than with previous printers in the same class,\" said Doug Johnson, marketing manager of HP's LaserJet Supplies Operation, in a statement.\nComputer Reseller News in September reported that the new HP \"mopier\" would be priced somewhere above $5,000.\n","154":"Sun Microsystems Inc. said Wednesday its profits rose 41 percent in the latest quarter and its revenues jumped to record levels, driven by sales of the company's server computer and power desktop systems.\nSun said its net income for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 29 rose to $178.3 million from $126 million in second quarter a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 46 cents from 32 cents.\nRevenues rose nearly 19 percent to $2.08 billion.\nThe per share earnings beat Wall Street expectations of 42 cents, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' earnings estimates.\n\"The current fiscal year continues to yield strong financial results,\" Sun Microsystems Chief Financial Officer Michael Lehman said in a statement. \"Sun is winning big in corporate intranets, the Internet, and the extranet.\"\nSo-called intranets are in-house networks modeled on the Internet, while extranets, which are secure networks outside a company, such as a private network.\nLehman said the company's investments in research and development and sales and support infrastructure were paying off as it moved to broaden its global presence.\nThe company said gross profit margins rose to 50.4 percent, up more than 5 percentage points from the comparable period the previous year.\nSun Microsystems Chief Executive Scott McNealy told analysts in a conference call that it was difficult to say whether the strong gross margins were sustainable.\nSun's order backlog rose to $470 million from $407 million in its first quarter, but it was still much less than the $522 million backlog at the end of its 1996 fiscal year last June.\nMcNealy said the company planned to announce new high-end computers, codenamed Starfire, next week as it seeks to offer computers that can be used for the most intensive corporate computing tasks, like databases and network management.\nLehman said initial market data showed Sun appeared to be taking market share from its traditional rivals, and he said Sun will continue to make further significant price cuts.\nThe executives said Sun was deriving increasing amounts of revenues from storage products, professional services and licensing of products based on the Java programming language, which is used to develop Internet applications.\n","155":"Seasoned computer industry executive John Young on Friday begins the search for a strong manager to take the helm of Novell Inc who can drive the company back to growth at the speed of the Internet.\nYoung, 64, was selected by Novell's board of directors on Tuesday to recruit fresh leadership for the struggling maker of computer network software after the board decided it should set a different course than that taken by Robert Frankenberg, its well-liked chairman and CEO of two years.  \n\"The board has asked me to be chairman, and to work with the management team and recruit a new CEO,\" said Young, who had himself served as chief executive of Palo Alto-based Hewlett- Packard Co for 15 years through 1992.\nNo quick fixes are expected, and Young made clear in an interview with Reuters at Novell's offices here late Thursday that he has no intention of serving in the role of chairman once he has completed the search for a chief executive.\n\"My experience with an executive search of this type is that four to six months is (a realistic time frame) when everything goes right, longer when it doesn't,\" he said.  \n\"That's as close to a time frame as I can give you and I do not expect to be involved other than as a director at the end of that period.\"\nNevertheless, the company already has an ambitious plan to revamp its corporate image, with a $20 million worldwide brand and product advertising campaign due to start next week, and to unveil a string of updated products.\nYoung and other top Novell executives believe the company now needs a hard-driving top executive who can operate on \"Internet time\" -- pushing the company to develop products more swiftly and better pinpoint customers' needs.  \nAlthough the company aims to build the near-mania zeal around Internet technologies into its own business plans, it is looking more for a \"street savvy\" executive who can speed the pace of business than a self-annoited Web hound, he said.\nIn fact, he said, while the executive must be able to act extremely quickly and turn technologies into products, he said he was \"not fond of the idea of regularly turning around product after product after product\" with the rapidity that Microsoft Corp and Netscape Communications Corp are launching new browsers, every few months.  \nIronically, Young is charged with replacing the man who had come to him 18 months ago, based on their two decades as business associates at Hewlett-Packard, and recruited him to joint Novell's board of directors.\n\"He asked me to join the board,\" Young said. \"He thought I would add some management expertise and perspective to the directors. So, yes, he recruited me.\"\nYoung and other executives said the departure was agreed on amicable terms, and had been subject of board-level discussion prior to Tuesday, so it had not been a hasty act.  \n\"These discussions had been under way. They were mutually agreed,\" one board member said. Young said the board had decided it needed to take \"a different way.\"\n\"It was quite amicable,\" he added. \"This wasn't some screaming match ... Bob is an enormously talented guy.\"\nIn fact, Frankenberg was credited with others in the industry for having taken difficult decisions in disposing of many assets his predecessor, patriarch Ray Noorda, had acquired in a virtually singular fixation that he was going to use Novell as a vehicle to outdo Microsoft chief Bill Gates.  \nNoorda had bought a string of operating systems and PC applications businesses, and was rumored in the industry to have funded additional secret development projects, as part of what was broadly viewed as an anti-Microsoft agenda.\nAssets were sold at fire sale prices. For example, WordPerfect Corp., purchased in 1994 for $1.4 billion in stock, was sold to Corel Corp  .TO early this year for stock worth about $130 million.  \nAs one example of new Internet prospects, Novell executive vice president Steve Markman said the company may work with Corel on technologies related to Corel's efforts to break its massive suite of products, many obtained from Novell, to create smaller Java language applications, or \"applets\".\n\"It's a tremendous opportunity to move the installed base to the Intranet space,\" he said, noting that Novell still enjoys a 63 percent share of the worldwide Network market, despite recent inroads by fiercely competitive Microsoft.\nNovell also will begin shipping three major product upgrades -- IntraNetWare, which includes the next version of its flagship NetWare product, Managewise 2.1 network management software, and its Groupwise 5 groupware applications -- within about a month.\nNevertheless, analysts said a real test for Novell would be whether it will be able to motivate its own employees, after years of transitions, and generate the excitement in the marketplace over its products which many rivals have created.\n","156":"Intel Corp. stock fell for the third straight day Friday on concerns that a series of upcoming price cuts could slow the company's momentum.\nThe stock tumbled $6.75 to $130.50, off a total of $16.125, or roughly 11 percent, since Tuesday.\nThe fall led the entire market lower, and analysts cited nervousness about Intel's first-quarter results, due after the market close on Monday. The earnings report will serve as a critical barometer of whether strong corporate earnings can keep underpinning stock values.\nIndustry analysts said Intel's quarterly price cuts on Pentium processors are expected to lead to slightly lower prices for personal computers. Some speculated that in expectation of rival chips, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s new K6, Intel will cut Pentium prices more than usual, from 25 percent to 30 percent.\n\"This continues to fuel normal PC demand,\" said Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest Inc in San Jose, Calif. \"This is the normal stuff that keeps stimulating the market.\"\nAccording to First Call, which tracks Wall Street estimates, analysts expect Intel to report a first-quarter profit of $2.07 a share, up from $1.02 a year ago, when Intel posted net income of $894 million on revenues of $4.64 billion.\nIf Intel meets those expectations, it will be the second straight quarter in which the world's largest maker of computer chips has more than doubled its year-on-year profits.\nAn Intel spokesman said the company could not comment this close to its earnings report, but the company said in mid-March -- within two weeks of the close of the quarter -- that market fundamentals \"remain very strong.\"\nIntel executives told analysts in January they expect revenues to be around $6.4 billion, about even with what it reported in the fourth quarter. Gross margins -- the difference between revenue and the costs of goods -- are expected to be even with or below the fourth quarter's 63 percent.\nAnalysts said Intel's bellwether role -- it has recently made a habit of re-energising flagging stock markets with particularly upbeat earnings reports -- is especially crucial given Wall Street's current moodiness.\nWall Street is particularly wary of the outlook for corporate earnings following the Federal Reserve's March 25 decision to raise interest rates and fresh speculation about chances of another rate increase based on Friday's report of underlying price pressures at the wholesale level in March.\n\"People are scared. Intel is one of the biggest holdings and they can still sell it at a profit,\" said David Wu, high-tech analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. \"They're scared because tech stocks are going down. If technology stocks can't do corporate earnings, you can forget about the rest.\nAnalysts said the much-heralded \"whisper\" number for Intel is for it to make $2.15 a share, and that even $2.20 a share could be possible given another blow-out quarter.\nBut, one analyst cautioned, \"anything less than $2.15 would not be good\" for the market.\nMarket researcher Dataquest said last week that Intel will continue to dominate the personal computer industry, where its processors currently account for 95 percent of the market, although clone-makers will start to make inroads this year.\nIntel spokesman Howard High said Friday the company will continue with its routine quarterly pricing changes, but that he saw no unusual changes in the upcoming pricing pattern from that to which the PC industry has grown accustomed.\n\"We do our price declines in a pretty predictable, orderly fashion,\" he said.\nAnalysts expect Intel to cut some prices when it unveils its new high-end Pentium II chip next month, and High said Intel's practice is to \"move other products down a notch\" to make room for the new processors.\n\"The movement is always in a relatively consistent direction, which is down. The rate is dependent on market conditions ... They (the pricing reductions) seem to have been pretty constant over the years,\" he added.\nIn February, Intel's pricing changes for its Pentium and Pentium Pro family of microprocessors ranged from no change at all to roughly a 34 percent decline, he noted.\nIntel's processors range in price from around $100 for the lower-end, older models to over $1,000 for the highest-end chips.\n","157":"Netscape Communications Corp., said Tuesday its quarterly revenues hit a record $100 million in the third quarter, demonstrating the surging popularity of its Internet software among companies setting up internal networks known as intranets.\nNetscape, which pioneered the popular Netscape Navigator browser software for cruising the Internet's World Wide Web, said its third quarter net income was $7.7 million, or 9 cents a share. A year ago, the fledgling company earned $175,000 on sales of $23.3 million.\n\"The third quarter of 1996 was another landmark quarter for Netscape, as Netscape server and client software solutions made significant inroads into the global enterprise market,\" said Netscape President and Chief Executive Jim Barksdale.\nWall Street, which had been expecting Netscape to report revenues of roughly $85 million to $90 million, had not expected the company to hit the $100 million quarterly revenue milestone until the second quarter next year, analysts said.\n\"I think the $100 million mark really shows significdant growth,\" said Hambrecht and Quist analyst Daniel Rimer, noting revenues grew 33 percent sequentially. \"This is major league revenue for a quarter.\"\nThe quarterly revenue was well above the $80.7 million it posted for the whole of 1995. For the first nine months, Netscape earned $12 million, or 14 cents a share, on sales of $231 million. A year earlier, the company lost $7 million, or 10 cents a share, on sales of $44 million.\nIn after-hours dealing, shares of Netscape were firm, changing hands as high as $44.875, up from its closing level of $44.50 in Nasdaq market trading.\nBarksdale said in an interview after the results that the indirect sales through third parties such as computer makers and systems integrators had accounted for 60 percent of overall sales, and 100 percent in Europe and Asia.\n\"We think it's a very efficient channel for us,\" he said. \"More and more we're seeing our job as demand creation through our direct sales force. We just think it's a more efficient way for these kind of products (to be sold).\"\n\"I'm very proud we have gotten to that as quickly, because we're very dependent on these people,\" he said.\nBarksdale outlined a broad range of companies which had chosen Netscape software to build applications for their computer networks, or \"intranet\" applications.\nAnalysts said the rapid growth of the market will help Netscape continue to grow in competition with rivals like Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development Corp.\nBarksdale said he remained concerned that competitors will be confused by the competitive frenzy, although he said key Netscape products remain lower in price those of Microsoft and Lotus, for example.\n","158":"Lotus Development Corp. Chief Executive Officer Michael Zisman said Wednesday the company will focus its attention on what could become a $1 billion market for collaborative Internet software by 1999.\nLotus, acquired by International Business Machines Corp. last year in a deal valued at more than $3 billion, should not try to be all things to all people, he said, but to concentrate its core business of software for groups, or so-called groupware.\n\"Collaboration is clearly our sweet spot,\" he said in a keynote address at a three-day Internet &amp; Electronic Commerce conference here organised by the Gartner Group.\nA new version of the company's popular Lotus Notes software due out in the fourth quarter, version 4.5, will offer Notes server software to host collaboration over the Internet. Servers are computers that manage the flow of data in a network.\nThis latter feature is provided by new Lotus technology dubbed Domino, which is currently being tested.\nZisman said too much attention was now devoted to browsers, software that lets users help navigate the Internet.\n\"The browser market is being eclipsed by the server market today as we speak,\" he said, noting browsers will most likely be offered as part of the operating system, as with Windows.\n\"The action, I believe, is going to be in the server market,\" he said, adding that server software for collaboration through Internet sites alone is projected to be a $1 billion market by the end of the decade.\nThe market for servers at the hub of Web sites will likely segment into at least three distinct classes -- content, collaboration and commerce -- and larger organisations will likely mix \"best of breed\" applications from different suppliers, he said.\nLotus Development is concentrating helping people work together electronically, he said, because \"content without collaboration is useless ... the value is not in the content.\"\nHe noted as an example Web sites which not only carried information, but enabled people to communicate interactively with the Web site or other individuals using the Internet.\n\"The borders are blurry. I don't believe that we will see pure content sites and I don't believe that we will see pure commerce sites,\" he said. \"We will obtain and retain customers if we engage them.\"\n","159":"Stocks of high-tech companies soared Wednesday after a potentially costly ballot proposal was voted down in California, and top executives found themselves relishing their roles as political activists.\nA group of top-level entrepreneurs and executives met behind closed doors Wednesday to work on a broader political alliance after the ballot measure, which would have made it easier for shareholders to file lawsuits, was defeated by a 3-1 margin.\n\"A year ago, this (Silicon) valley politically was naive, not involved, not organized and not effective,\" said John Doerr, the partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers who led opposition to the ballot measure, known as Proposition 211.\nThe measure was promoted by a group of securities lawyers including San Diego attorney William Lerach, whose lawsuits brought on behalf of shareholders after a company's stock plunges irritate corporate executives.\nBut California's high-tech firms jumped into action, raising an estimated $38 million and mobilizing 5 million employees, shareholders and customers in a major grass-roots campaign in the months before election day.\nThat amount, coupled with $13 million spent by proponents of 211, rivaled the money spent by labor groups nationwide as they sought to put friendly legislators, mostly Democrats, in Congress.\nIt was also more than was needed to start up Sun Microsystems Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., and Intel Corp. combined.\nFinal returns show the measure lost by a 3-1 margin, which brought relief to Wall Street investors who were nervous that passage would bring a raft of shareholder lawsuits to California.\nShares of high-tech companies surged on the news, with Intel soaring $4.75 to an all-time high of $118.75 on Nasdaq. After the market closed, the company released bullish news on its fourth quarter business trends.\nTexas Instruments jumped $4.25 to $53 on the New York Stock Exchange and Microsoft added $3 to $144.50 on Nasdaq.\n\"We defeated the jackals of Proposition 211, the carrion feeders who take away our profits,\" James Cramer, principal of money management firm Cramer Partners in New York, said of the stock rally.\nSilicon Valley executives, who had warned of wide-scale resignations of officers and directors in California if the measure had passed, applauded its defeat and said they would support continued political activism.\nJohn Young, acting chairman of Novell Inc., said the campaign was unprecedented among high tech firms, and could be the start of a multi-year corporate commitment.\nCisco Systems Chief Executive John Chambers said his company and others had been so focused on fast-changing high-tech markets that they had neglected politics.\n\"We were concerned with just doing our business and we were letting other people fight our fights for us, which is wrong,\" he said.\nWhile political activism could be a distraction, it was also important to address political issues before they got out of control, he said.\n\"It's 'pay me now or pay me later,'\" he said in an interview, predicting continued political engagement.\nDoerr told chief executives, corporate lawyers and venture capitalists gathered at a celebration late on Tuesday that he expected executives now to focus on issues of fostering growth, education, legal reform and economic opportunity.\nHe said the anti-211 effort demonstrated Silicon Valley to be \"a state of mind, not a place,\" which due to the spread of high-tech businesses, in effect, extends from Massachusetts to California and from Florida to Washington state.\nExecutives here are already talking about the prospect of another battle with plaintiff's lawyers, who are rumored to be mulling new ballot initiatives in other states, or the possibility of targeting high tech firms more narrowly.\n","160":"China Tuesday announced a ban on poultry and poultry products from Missouri and Oklahoma, citing what it said was the outbreak of a deadly disease.\nThe ban, which took effect Monday, was aimed at preventing damage from the \"very destructive\" Newcastle disease, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture told Reuters.\nOfficial news reports said the ban was slapped on poultry products from the two states because of five cases of the disease discovered between July and September.\nThe disease, known as viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease, or VVND, is deadly.\nHowever, Phillip Holloway, representative in Hong Kong and China for the Oklahoma state agriculture department, said he had not heard of any recent cases of VVND in Oklahoma.\n\"It's a very, very dangerous disease -- the most feared of poultry diseases,\" he said. \"The symptoms are like influenza, and once one bird gets the disease, all the poultry will die.\"\nThe poultry industries of Oklahoma and Missouri were far down on the list of top U.S. producers and exporters, Holloway said. \"My estimate is that Oklahoma and Missouri account for less than 5 percent of U.S. poultry exports to China.\"\nArkansas is the country's biggest poultry producer and home of industry giant Tyson Foods Inc.\nA source at Tyson's Hong Kong office said VVND was known to exist in China, but this could not be confirmed.\nBeijing has also banned all U.S. poultry brought into the country either by mail or hand-carried by travelers, according to the Ministry of Agriculture official.\nThe last major outbreak of VVND in the United States occurred in California in the 1970s and led to the eradication of the state's entire poultry population, Holloway said.\nThe United States exports around $500 million of poultry and poultry products a year to China, its biggest market after Russia.\nThe Chinese quarantine official told Reuters that the action was unrelated to other trade disputes with the United States and there were no plans to delay implementation of the decision.\nBeijing and Washington are at odds over textile imports, and that dispute has threatened to spill over into the farm sector. China had threatened to ban some U.S. farm goods -- as well as textiles and alcoholic drinks -- in retaliation for U.S. penalties on textiles purchased from China.\nOn Sunday, Beijing announced it was delaying for one month implementation of those curbs, which had been scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, because the two sides were planning to hold further talks on the issue.\nIn October, China announced a ban on imports of poultry from 10 U.S. states because of fears it carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza. China and the United States held talks on the issue and the ban did not go into effect.\n","161":"China will avoid bold moves in tackling its ailing state enterprises as it focuses on stability ahead of this year's crucial Communist Party congress, analysts said on Monday.\nThey said policy makers would err on the side of caution in a year billed by Beijing as one of the most significant of the communist era.\n\"Reform of state enterprises is the nation's biggest economic problem but it is an extremely difficult one to solve,\" said economist Cheng Xiusheng of the Development Research Centre of the State Council, or cabinet.\n\"I would not expect any major breakthroughs this year.\"\nAs China sheds the vestiges of a centrally planned economy, it wants state-owned companies, which have grown fat under government nurturing, to be leaner and better able to compete in the marketplace.\nAbout 75 percent of state firms are losing money. Losses surged to about 69 billion yuan ($8.3 billion) in the first 10 months of last year, a rise of 45 percent over the same period of 1995, officials have said.\nHalting those losses would mean shedding much of the workforce and in some cases making use of bankruptcy laws to dissolve companies.\nChina's rulers have vowed to push ahead with reforms of the state sector but analysts are betting that the scale of any changes will be limited.\nAnalysts note that China has set a target of keeping urban unemployment around three percent this year, little changed from the official figure issued in the recent past.\n\"The problem is there is no social safety net,\" said a Western diplomat.\nChina has no real unemployment insurance system and retirement schemes cover only a fraction of the working public.\nAs most social welfare benefits stem from the employer, the loss of a job could have a huge impact on the individual.\nOn a wider scale it could mean social unrest.\n\"The Chinese realise where the problem lies,\" said the diplomat. \"The trick is being able to make tough political decisions.\"\nThat is unlikely this year as China's leaders prepare for the party congress that will set policies over the medium term.\n\"No one wants to go into that meeting with the threat of social unrest,\" said another diplomat.\nBeijing is also loath to take risks as it awaits the recovery of Hong Kong on July 1 after more than 150 years of British rule. It wants a smooth handover.\nSome economists had hoped communist leaders would turn their attention to the deep-rooted problems of the state sector this year after Beijing effectively declared victory in its other major campaign -- the battle against inflation.\nChina wrestled inflation down to six percent last year from 14.8 percent in 1995 and a communist-era high of more than 21 percent in 1994, according to official data.\nEconomic leaders were confident enough inflation had been licked to allow state-set prices for postal rates and local telephone calls -- long held at subsidised levels -- to rise sharply last month.\nBut economists said that this year at least, Beijing would prefer to continue with some of its subsidies rather than pay the social cost of putting ailing companies out of business.\n","162":"China trumpeted the 100-day mark for the recovery of Hong Kong on Sunday and hailed late leader Deng Xiaoping for his guiding role in bringing more than a century of colonial shame to a close.\nHundreds of people gathered at midnight near Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing to watch a huge electronic countdown clock as it flashed only 100 days to go before the British colony reverts to Chinese rule on July 1.\nOfficial newspapers covered their front pages with reports of the impending end of British colonial rule as called for under a Sino-British accord signed in 1984.\n\"We have endured 100 years of shame, 100 years of resistance and 100 years of waiting,\" said the Guangming Daily.\n\"Now in another 100 days, the hopes of generations will be realised.\"\nThe Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, devoted much of its front page to the historic occasion and the role played in it by the nation's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who died last month aged 92 before he could see his dream fulfilled.\nDeng guided China's negotiations with Britain and is credited with devising the formula of \"one country, two systems\" that allows Hong Kong to keep its capitalist system and a \"high degree of autonomy\" for 50 years.\n\"At this moment we think even more fondly of Deng Xiaoping,\" said the party newspaper.\n\"It was he who proposed the great formula of 'one country, two systems' that allowed us to peacefully resolve a thorny question left over from history and realise the complete reunification of our country...\"\nThat praise was echoed by some of the hundreds of people who braved Beijing's chilly night air to watch the countdown clock mark the last 100 days before the transfer of power in Hong Kong.\n\"This is Deng's contribution,\" said a retired office worker surnamed Chang. \"I am overjoyed.\"\nA huge roar erupted from the crowd at midnight as students waved banners saying, \"China takes the road to strength\" and chanted \"Hong Kong comes home\".\n\"I'm thrilled,\" said An Na, a student at the Chemical Industry Institute. \"I wish I didn't have to wait 100 days.\"\nChina ceded Hong Kong island to Britain in 1842 under the Treaty of Nanjing following the Opium War, and Britain later added to its holdings in the area.\nWhile China hailed the impending recovery of Hong Kong, it had barely a passing word for the British government that decided to hand back the colony peacefully rather than contest its claim to the territory.\nThe official media also had little to say about China's pledges of a \"high degree of autonomy\" under the joint accord, though it hinted at concerns in Hong Kong and elsewhere.\nThe Shenzhen Special Zone Daily, published in the border boom town of Shenzhen near Hong Kong, tried to reassure residents of Hong Kong about a report on the Chinese army garrison that will be stationed in the territory.\n\"Don't worry, dear compatriots,\" it advised its readers, without saying what they might have to worry about.\nThe People's Daily similarly sought to deflect concerns.\n\"More and more people are coming to the belief that the Chinese government is reliable and capable and will faithfully carry out its promises,\" it said.\n","163":"China has captured the big prize in its recognition battle with rival Taiwan after South Africa announced plans to switch formal ties to Beijing.\nBut the lengthy transition of more than one year signals that much bargaining remains on the shape of future relations between the three governments, diplomats in Beijing said on Thursday.\n\"We...welcome (South African) President Nelson Mandela's positive statement concerning normalisation of relations between China and South Africa,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing.\n\"If South Africa can recognise reality at an earlier date it is in its own interests to do so,\" he said.\n\"This is in keeping with the basic interests of the peoples of the two countries,\" Cui said.\nMandela told reporters in Johannesburg on Wednesday that Pretoria would switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing by the end of 1997.\nCui declined to comment on Pretoria's decision to switch only by the end of next year.\n\"South Africa must recognise there is only one China, recognise that Taiwan is a part of China and sever so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan,\" Cui said.\n\"Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. The People's Republic of China government is the sole, legitimate government of all China,\" he said.\n\"This has been our longstanding stand. It is very clear... Our stand has not changed,\" the spokesman said.\nSouth Africa is the biggest of just 30 states that recognise Taiwan's exiled Republic of China rather than the communist People's Republic on the mainland.\nTaiwan and China have been separated since a civil war ended in 1949. China sees Taiwan as a rebel province not entitled to foreign ties while Taiwan insists its 21 million people should have a voice in international affairs.\n\"The South Africans have been the big fish for China,\" said a Beijing-based diplomat. \"The others are just minnows.\"\nBut in most diplomatic divorces, the break is swift, and diplomats said South Africa was still trying to work out its future relationship with both sides.\n\"They are trying to gain maximum concessions out of the two sides,\" said a diplomat.\nSouth Africa is probably looking for a package deal that includes investment and trade guarantees under a formal legal framework with Taiwan.\nIt is also hoping to limit damage.\nMandela, announcing the break wtih Taiwan, pointedly thanked the island for its economic support during his nation's transition from minority, white rule to democracy.\nThe announcement well ahead of formal recognition would also help South Africa preserve its consulate in the British colony of Hong Kong - which returns to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997.\nSouth Africa had been hoping to maintain official relations with both sides, a goal that proved unrealistic.\nTaiwan had also been looking to duplicate a framework with the Pacific states of Fiji, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea which have formal relations with Beijing but have signed a \"mutual recognition pact\" with Taipei, diplomats said.\n\"These smaller states may get away with a format such as this but South Africa apparently was not in the same category,\" said a diplomat.\n","164":"China plans to develop bigger rockets to carry heavier payloads into space and expand its role in the commercial satellite market, Chinese aerospace officials said on Thursday.\nThe ambitious, long-term goal was to build rockets that could carry 20-tonne payloads -- more than twice the current capacity of the nation's most powerful launch vehicles, they said.\n\"This is a long-term goal that could stretch into the second decade of the next century,\" said a spokeswoman for China Aerospace Corp, which coordinates China's satellite launch business.\n\"China needs rockets to put multiple satellites into orbit -- both for its own domestic use and to help its position in the commercial space market,\" she told Reuters.\nChina's existing rockets have the capacity to carry payloads of 9.2 tonnes for lower earth orbits and 3.4-5.0 tonnes for geosynchronous orbits.\nIt has already launched multiple satellites on a single launch but officials say more development is needed.\n\"We will begin a development programme as soon as possible to lay a firm foundation for the new development of Chinese launch vehicle technology in the 21st century,\" said Li Jianzhong, president of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.\n\"We will develop technologies, especially some key technologies for a heavy lift launch vehicle with a payload of 20 tonnes,\" he said in a paper delivered at an international conference on space technology.\nHe also said China would continue to study reusable space transport systems such as the U.S. space shuttle and manned flights -- although officials said these plans were unlikely to be taken into the development stage anytime soon.\nChina, which put its first satellite in orbit in 1970, has been trying to expand its role in the commercial space market, despite a series of recent setbacks.\nA Chinese Long March 3 rocket, considered one of the nation's more reliable launch vehicles, failed to put a U.S.-built satellite into proper orbit in August.\n\"It was due to a tiny problem with a valve leakage,\" a scientist who worked on the rocket told Reuters.\n\"But that small error meant the whole launch was a failure.\"\nIn February, technical flaws had even more disastrous results when a Long March 3B rocket exploded shortly after lift-off, killing at least six people and injuring 57.\nChina says it still has a high success rate for its satellite launches but the latest setbacks have tarnished its reputation.\nBeijing also sees a need to step up its satellite production technology.\n\"We are behind the West in rocket technology but we are even farther behind in satellites,\" said the China Aerospace spokeswoman. \"We need to be able to build more sophisticated satellites with more transponders.\"\nThe development plans will require a lot of funding, and although senior Communist Party officials are backing the space campaign, there are plenty of other government projects that demand a share of the budget.\nChinese officials declined to say how much money would be committed to the rocket development project or the space sector overall.\n\"I can say that our space budget is merely a fraction of what the United States spends on its space programme,\" said a senior aerospace official.\n","165":"China's once strained ties with the United States have improved dramatically in recent months with a series of top level visits healing some of the old wounds.\nBut as the two nations move closer, the United States is sidestepping one of China's most sensitive figures -- Premier Li Peng -- who is still too closely linked to the 1989 crushing of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, diplomats said on Sunday.\nThey said that Li is one Chinese leader who does not fit into the agenda for a visit to Washington.\n\"It may be a bit unfair but he is the one leader everyone remembers for his role in the (1989) crackdown,\" said a senior foreign diplomat.\nLast month U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made his first visit to China in two years, setting the stage for the series of meetings between other high ranking officials of the two countries.\nDuring Christopher's visit, the two sides reached an understanding that their relationship should not be side-tracked by any one issue. That meant contacts would proceed despite continued disagreements over a range of issues from human rights, to trade and China's political rivalry with Taiwan.\nChinese Minister of Defence Chi Haotian is now in the United States after twice delaying a visit -- both times due to tension over Taiwan. He met President Bill Clinton on Monday last week.\nClinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin held talks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in the Philippines last month, and an exchange of visits by the two leaders is planned over 1997 and 1998.\nU.S. Vice President Al Gore is expected to visit China some time during the first half of next year.\nBut there is no talk yet of a return visit to the United States by Premier Li, Gore's counterpart in the Chinese government.\nU.S. officials in Beijing played down the lack of an invitation, saying the timing of the Gore visit itself had not been set.\nOther foreign analysts said an invitation would be made but there was little chance of a visit before a new premier takes office in 1998.\nChina is expected to sort out its leadership line-up at the Communist Party congress late next year and then formally install new government figures at the parliament meeting in March 1998.\n\"They (the Americans) seem to be waiting for the selection of the next premier,\" said another foreign diplomat.\nWestern leaders, including Americans, have been willing to meet Li in China. But for some of them, hosting him in their own country is another matter, diplomats said.\nLi has been tarred with the decision to use military force to crush the pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, though paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was the only man with sufficient clout to order in the army.\nPresident Jiang was also elevated to his role as Communist Party chief because of his tough stance on dissent.\nLi has not visited the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia since 1989. He has travelled to Germany, France and Canada since then, though he has been dogged by controversy on each trip.\n","166":"China's central bank chief has said that inflation would be a modest seven percent this year and this showed the state's economic policies were working.\nBut Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, lashed out at companies that had taken advantage of tight money policies used to tackle inflation by lending money at excessively high rates.\n\"The appropriately tight monetary polices have achieved clear results which have been acknowledged both in China and abroad,\" Dai was quoted as saying in the Financial News on Monday.\n\"We can now control inflation to about seven percent for the full year,\" he said.\nChina's retail inflation stood at 6.9 percent year-on-year in the first seven months and at 5.9 percent in July alone.\nBeijing has said it wanted to keep inflation within 10 percent for 1996, down from 14.8 percent last year and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.\nBut the central bank chief had harsh words for companies that had taken advantage of the tough austerity programme put in place three years ago to deal with the worst days of inflation.\nHe did not name any of the offenders but he said that some \"monopoly groups\" and publicly listed companies were lending out money at excessively high rates.\nTsingtao Brewery, which has stock listed in Hong Kong as well as in Shanghai, has run afoul of regulatory authorities in the British colony in the past for lending out funds raised from its public offer.\nA senior Chinese economist who asked not to be named said several big ministries were cash-rich and able to earn more than bank deposit rates by lending out their funds.\n\"The big offenders are some cash-rich ministries,\" said the economist. \"They can earn 16-18 percent on their money.\"\nThat would compare with interest of 7.47 percent earned on one-year bank deposits.\nOther economists have said that higher rates were available for even more speculative lending.\nDai gave no indication of whether any measures were being planned to address these problems, although he said that funds in the banking system were unevenly distributed.\nHe said that China had already taken steps to curb illegal money market trade and that it had taken steps to ensure that other unauthorised financial organisations did not act as commercial banks.\n\"There are many violations of financial regulations,\" Dai was quoted as saying. \"There must be an expansion of supervision over the financial sector.\"\n","167":"Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin has put his personal stamp on the legacy of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping with a television paean aimed at portraying him as the 92-year-old patriarch's rightful heir, analysts said.\nThe primetime television series was also carefully crafted to limit the role of those who might challenge Jiang's claim to the Deng mantle or who might disagree with his version of the patriarch's role, they said on Monday.\n\"This was building up Deng to build up Jiang,\" said a Western diplomat who has long experience with China.\nThat view was widely shared by China analysts.\n\"Jiang wants to use the Deng legacy to build up his own public image,\" said another diplomat.\nChina Central Television spent four years on the series that traced Deng's personal long march from his birthplace in southwestern Sichuan province to the pinnacle of power.\nIn a breathless tone, it heaped praise on the veteran leader for his pragmatic policies that made his countrymen both proud and prosperous.\nState television estimated 224 million people -- 28 percent of the 800 million people who have access to television -- watched the programme broadcast over 12 successive evenings.\nJiang, who is officially referred to as the \"core\" of the third generation of China's leadership, introduced the series and entered the final judgment on Deng's contribution to building a modern Chinese state.\n\"He is a worthy outstanding Marxist and a stalwart communist,\" Jiang said of the man whose reforms turned a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse.\nDeng has not been seen in public in nearly three years and his last appearance showed him looking frail and faltering.\nThe final episode of the television series showed Deng announcing his retirement from his last official post in 1989 when he stepped down from the party's powerful central military commission.\nSeen strolling with Jiang at his side, Deng called on the party to rally round his anointed successor.\nAnalysts said much of the drama from an otherwise predictable series stemmed from what was omitted.\nThe series made no mention of Deng's previous anointed successor Zhao Ziyang, the man most closely linked with guiding China's reforms until he was dismissed in the power struggle that accompanied the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing in 1989.\nViewers received only a brief glimpse of Zhao, who has been under house arrest since 1989, as he was shown signing the historic Sino-British accord of 1984 that returns Hong Kong to China this year.\nThe late Hu Yaobang, Deng's other heir apparent who fell from grace, was given a perfunctory mention while former President Yang Shangkun, who was dropped in 1993 amid fears he was building up his own faction to mount a leadership challenge, made only a brief appearance.\nDeng's children were shown alongside the elderly leader, holding him steady as he walked on uncertain feet, speaking into his one good ear or buttoning his tunic. They had no opportunity to give their own assessment of the man who is patriarch of their family as well as the Communist Party.\nWhile the series paid homage to Deng's 1992 tour of southern China's special economic zones, which he used to kick-start stalled reforms, viewers saw a sanitised version.\n\"A key part of the southern tour was Deng's anti-leftist theme,\" said a Chinese academic. \"This made no mention of that.\"\nAnalysts said Jiang was placating the Communist Party's left wing as he prepares for the party congress scheduled for later this year, a pivotal meeting that will set the nation's political and economic course for the next five years.\n\"By holding tightly to the Deng legacy he is trying to demonstrate that he is the one to interpret Deng,\" said a China analyst. \"And he is the one who will set the tone for the congress.\"\n","168":"China ushered in 1997, a year it has hailed as one of the most significant of the communist era for the impending recovery of Hong Kong, with a paean to senior leader Deng Xiaoping, the man who made it all possible.\nChina Central Television broadcast on Wednesday the first episode of a documentary lauding the 92-year-old political patriarch, a man whose pragmatic policies turned a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse and helped regain capitalist Hong Kong from Britain.\nThe primetime programme, to be shown over 12 days, would set the tone for a crucial Communist Party congress due later this year, largely by defining Deng's legacy to the current party leadership, Chinese and Western political analysts said.\n\"This is an extremely important year for the Communist Party with the recovery of Hong Kong and the holding of the 15th party congress,\" a Western diplomat said.\n\"China's leaders are reminding people that Deng was instrumental in regaining Hong Kong, and they are also using him to define their own policies at the congress and in the post-Deng era.\"\nDeng has not been seen in public in nearly three years. At his last appearance he looked frail and unsteady.\nThe documentary showed a vigorous leader, larger than life and portrayed against a background of golden clouds radiating across the sky.\nHe was seen inspecting factories while donning a hard hat, shaking hands with children and receiving gifts of poppies in Paris in the 1970s.\nThe main theme of the one-hour show was clearly reform, underlining China's commitment to its course of market-oriented economic change charted by Deng and continued under his chosen successor President Jiang Zemin.\nBut its use of adulatory tones -- opposed by Deng who abhorred the personality cult of revolutionary leader Mao Zedong -- suggested that the ageing party veteran had little or no control over the documentary's contents.\nSpeculation about Deng's health surfaces periodically and an unconfirmed report described him as lapsing briefly into unconsciousness this week.\nSome Hong Kong newspaper reports said he had been admitted to a top military hospital but there were no unusual movements this week at the Beijing medical centre where senior officials are usually treated.\nDeng had vowed to visit Hong Kong to witness the historic transfer of power at midnight on June 30 this year but a Beijing official believed to be close to the Deng family said recently this was unlikely.\nOn Wednesday, the People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, called on China's 1.2 billion people to uphold Deng's credo of pragmatism known as \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\".\nIn an article published earlier this week the newspaper described the television series on the life of the nation's paramount leader as one that \"showed in their entirety the glorious achievements and greatness of the theories of comrade Deng Xiaoping.\"\nThe documentary had taken four years to complete and included interviews with more than 100 senior officials, according to official media.\nPreviews from the series showed Deng giving words of encouragement to party officials and reviewing China's military might -- interspersed with glimpses of sleek skyscrapers and modern factories, symbols of the material progress inspired by the party patriarch.\n\"This is very much linked to the party congress,\" said a Chinese academic. \"It is setting the tone for those taking part in the party congress.\"\nPresident and Communist Party chief Jiang narrated parts of the episode seen on television and was shown giving his assessment that Deng had made an important contribution to the building of a modern, socialist China.\nJiang is widely seen as the man who has the most to gain from the adulation for the paramount leader.\n\"This shows he (Jiang) has the mantle of Deng,\" said another Western diplomat.\n\"He is building up himself by building up Deng.\"\n","169":"China said Monday it expected talks with the United States soon on a dispute over U.S. sanctions on its textiles and its own threat to retaliate.\nBeijing also said it was still too soon to say which U.S. imports would be banned if Washington failed to withdraw penalties on imported Chinese textiles.\n\"We expect to see working level talks with the U.S. in the near future,\" an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation told Reuters. \"The two sides will exchange views,\" he said.\nBeijing said Sunday it would suspend temporarily its imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods, animal husbandry products, fruits and alcoholic drinks in retaliation for Washington's imposition of punitive charges on American purchases of Chinese textiles.\nThe temporary import ban is to take effect on Dec. 10.\nIn September, Washington announced punitive charges against import quotas for Chinese textile goods, accusing China of using shipments through other countries to avoid U.S. quota restrictions.\nChina said the action was taken without consultation and with no clear supporting evidence, adding that it had no choice but to impose retaliatory sanctions.\n\"We are still seeking the views of Chinese enterprises about which products should be included under the ban,\" the Chinese official said. \"That will be determined in another 30 days.\"\nThe total of trade affected by Washington's action was estimated at $19 million -- only a fraction of Sino-U.S. trade, which is now heavily in China's favour. The United States says its trade deficit with China last year was more than $35 billion.\nChina's threatened trade ban, made ahead of a planned visit to Beijing this month by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, meant yet another face-off in the frequently testy Sino-U.S. ties.\nRelations have been strained over the last year by a range of issues, from Taiwan to arms proliferation to trade and human rights.\nChina and the United States have said they saw an improvement in relations since they narrowly averted a trade war over copyright piracy and exchanged diplomatic fire over Beijing's political rival Taiwan earlier this year.\nThe two sides are preparing for high-level exchanges next year, including a possible visit to China by Vice President Al Gore and a summit between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton.\nChristopher's visit was expected to pave the way for these meetings.\n","170":"China needs to extend bank credits to help boost its flagging export sector, a top trade official was quoted as saying on Sunday.\nMinister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi wanted commercial and subsidised bank credits, particularly for machinery and electrical equipment makers, the Financial Daily reported.\n\"First of all, I believe that the state should expand the size of its export lending,\" Wu said.\n\"It should maximize its use of domestic credits, finding new sources of credit, and expand use of foreign loans to boost exports of complete plants and equipment.\"\nChina's exports for the first eight months of the year were $90.61 billion, down 4.2 percent over the previous year, according to official figures.\nExports in July and August showed an improvement, however, after the government speeded up long delayed payments of export rebates.\nWu said commercial banks should be encouraged to make policy loans that might not be commercially attractive, and that state subsidies would be required.\n\"We want to encourage commercial banks to take on policy loans. With the assistance of the Export-Import Bank, the state will implement necessary financial subsidies,\" she said.\nThe minister said that big, turnkey projects required large amounts of capital and lengthy periods before they were completed.\nWhile the projects were in progress, exporters had to deal with inflationary cost pressures, exchange rate fluctuations and tax rebate delays.\n\"In order to expand exports of complete plants and equipment we need an overall system to provide financial security for these companies,\" she said.\n\"This will effectively encourage exports of machinery and complete plants and equipment.\"\nWu said she was confident China could reach its total trade goal of $281 billion this year, though she gave no figure for exports.\n","171":"Officials with Volkswagen-First Automotive Works in northeastern China on Monday dismissed a report that the joint venture faced possible closure.\n\"This report is incorrect,\" said a spokeswoman of the joint venture, referring to a report by the German news magazine Der Spiegel.\n\"Production is still continuing,\" she said in a telephone interview from Changchun.\n\"We have a 25-year agreement. If the German side withdrew unilaterally, they would have to pay compensation,\" she said. She added that the two sides would soon hold a ceremony marking the full implementation of the joint venture project.\nA spokesman for Volkswagen AG's Volkswagen Asia-Pacific arm in Hong Kong also said production at the joint venture would continue.\n\"There is no reason to leave Changchun,\" he said.\nDer Spiegel said the Changchun plant was losing money and production of the Jetta car had practically ceased.\nThe Hong Kong-based official said the factory had produced 14,700 Jetta cars in the first eight months of this year, up 10 percent from a year ago.\nThe Jetta was not selling as well as the Volkswagen Santana produced at Volkswagen's Shanghai joint venture, but that operation had taken the lion's share of the domestic passenger car market, he said.\nHowever, some changes in the joint venture agreement were being negotiated, including the introduction of new car models as well as the possibility of Volkswagen taking over sales and after-sales service, the official added.\nFirst Automotive Works had been producing Audi 100s at its own production line in Changchun under a seven-year licensing agreement that expired in June. The Audi 200 was now being built at the joint venture, and 400 have been produced since June.\nA total of 7,445 Audi 100s were built from January to June this year, the Volkswagen official said.\nFirst Automotive has also sold 4,120 of its Red Flag cars, an Audi-based car that the Chinese company produces separately from the joint venture using a Chrysler Corp engine, according to Volkswagen.\n","172":"China on Thursday tried to play down friction with the United States over a rising trade gap and called on the U.S. to end curbs on technology exports to put trade back in balance.\n\"The two sides should avoid taking actions that do not help the expansion of trade,\" said a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.\n\"These are two of the biggest markets in the world,\" he said. \"They should be complementary.\"\nThe United States said on Wednesday its trade deficit with China climbed to nearly $29 billion in the first nine months of the year, from $25 billion in the same period last year.\nThe trade gap, already the second largest for the U.S. after its deficit with Japan, was seen reaching $40 billion by the end of the year, up from $34 billion in 1995.\nAmerican economists said the mounting deficit was likely to create new frictions between the two countries.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor said the growth in the deficit with China had slowed, but he called on Beijing to live up to its international trade obligations.\nA group of influential U.S. senators, in a letter to President Bill Clinton, questioned Beijing's trade practices and said China should not be allowed to join the World Trade Organisation on special terms because it would harm American economic interests.\nBeijing has been seeking to join the global trade body on favourable terms given to developing nations, but Washington has insisted that China's economy was too big for this treatment.\nThe Chinese Trade Ministry spokesman said Washington's policy curbs on U.S. exports were part of the bilateral trade problem. \"There are policy rulings that are holding back U.S. exports,\" he said. \"Where there are limits on technology exports, this is a lost export opportunity for the United States.\"\nThe U.S. appeared to be moving to address this matter.\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Washington was considering allowing technical cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear technology despite concerns about safeguards over re-exports.\nChristopher, after meeting with Chinese leaders in Beijing, said the U.S. was looking at taking steps that eventually could allow American companies to sell their technology to China.\nA Chinese economist suggested some of the criticism over trade was unfairly directed at China as U.S. imports were mainly labour intensive products that were not manufactured in the United States.\n\"If the U.S. does not buy these products from China it will buy them elsewhere,\" said Wang Jian, an economist with the State Planning Commission. \"These are goods produced by developing countries.\"\nBut the economist conceded that bilateral trade problems could spill over into broader trade issues.\n\"The U.S. already is the main obstacle to China's plan to join the World Trade Organisation,\" he said, adding that renewed Sino-U.S. trade friction could further complicate the issue.\n","173":"China moved ahead on Wednesday with plans to host U.S. Vice President Al Gore, the most senior American visitor in eight years, ignoring a flap over alleged Beijing funding for the United States Democratic Party.\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman denied the funding allegations and said they would not affect this month's visit which both sides have portrayed as part of efforts to mend damaged ties.\n\"The Chinese and American sides are actively preparing for the visit,\" a ministry spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday.\nThe allegations of Chinese assistance to the Democrats were made by \"people with ulterior motives\", the spokesman said.\nThe Washington Post reported on Sunday that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation had warned six members of Congress last year that they had been targeted by China to receive illegal campaign contributions from foreign corporations.\nU.S. investigators had found what officials called conclusive evidence that Chinese government funds were funnelled into the United States in 1996, the newspaper said.\nChina and the United States have been hoping to use Gore's visit, scheduled for March 24-28, to help restore ties strained in recent years by a host of issues ranging from Taiwan and trade to arms and human rights.\nGore would become the most senior U.S. official to visit China since then-President George Bush toured Beijing in early 1989. That trip was marred by a flap over a U.S. decision to invite a prominent dissident to a banquet in honour of China's leaders.\nChinese and American officials have given few details of Gore's trip, though an advance team is expected in Beijing this week to make final preparations.\nThe vice president's visit is expected to pave the way for an exchange of summits between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton.\nBeijing has been angered by the allegations that it made illegal contributions to the Democrats, saying it had neither the interest nor the financial ability to make such payments.\n\"We do not have the money to support U.S. political parties,\" a ministry spokesman told reporters on Tuesday.\nA U.S. congressional committee investigating campaign funding abuses has issued subpoenas to the White House and Justice Department for information on any alleged Chinese government involvement in funnelling money for the 1996 U.S. presidential election.\nA senior Chinese foreign ministry official had made serious representations to the U.S. charge d'affairs in Beijing over the accusations of illegal donations, the official Xinhua news agency said on Monday.\nClinton's Democratic Party has already returned $3 million in questionable cash to various donors, most of them with Asian ties.\nGore himself has been tarred with allegations by Republicans that he may have violated the law by pressing for contributions to the Democratic Party during the 1996 election campaign. He has insisted he broke no laws.\nClinton has used the issue to renew an appeal for reform in U.S. campaign financing laws.\nThe U.S. Senate voted on Tuesday to expand its investigation of campaign fundraising abuses from just illegal actions to illegal and improper activities.\nWhile diplomats say Beijing and Washington are determined to prevent their many differences from outweighing areas of common interest, frosty exchanges have remained a frequent feature of the Sino-U.S. diplomatic dialogue.\nIn its annual report on human rights, the U.S. State Department accused Beijing of effectively silencing public dissent in 1996 through jailings, intimidation or exile.\nOn Wednesday, China's official Legal Daily repeated Beijing's response to the U.S. report, saying it had interfered in the internal affairs of other countries and had aroused objections around the world.\n","174":"China issued tough new rules on the handling of blood products on Sunday in a move that follows the sale of HIV-tainted blood serum.\nThe official Xinhua news agency said the rules covered the production and distribution of blood products and set strict supervisory standards throughout the health industry.\nIt also said the 5,000-word ruling set harsh punishments for violators, though it gave no details of the regulations themselves and made no mention of the discovery last April of tainted blood products manufactured and sold in China.\nBut the news agency underscored the importance of the order by noting that it had been issued by the State Council, or cabinet, and signed by Premier Li Peng.\nIn a highly unusual move, China's Foreign Ministry admitted in October last year that some samples of blood product serum albumin made under the \"Wolongsong\" brand name were contaminated with HIV, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which can lead to AIDS.\nChina's Ministry of Public Health began a national drive to test all blood products after the discovery of the contaminated product in the southern province of Guangdong in April last year.\nHealth officials banned the sale of at least some types of the product and ordered the destruction of stockpiles.\nOfficials in Guangdong, contacted at the time of the Foreign Ministry announcement, declined to give any information on the manufacturer, explain how the product became tainted or say how much of it was on the market when the action was taken.\nThe number of reported HIV cases in China stood at 5,157 by the end of October last year.\nBut Chinese officials have quoted health experts as saying they believe the actual number was anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 as many cases go unreported.\nA total of 133 people have been infected with AIDS in China, according to the official media.\nChina has been grappling with growing drug abuse and prostitution, and experts warn these two problems could increase the number of AIDS cases.\n","175":"China said on Friday it was concerned its trade surplus with the United States might affect ties and released a White Paper in defence of its policies.\nVice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Sun Zhenyu said Beijing was taking steps to trim the surplus but action was also needed by the U.S. government and American industry.\n\"The issue has become such a general concern to American people from all walks of life that failure to handle the issue properly could hold up the normal development of the economic and trade relations between the two countries,\" Sun said in a statement given to reporters.\nThe statement was one of the most visible signs that Beijing policymakers were looking for ways to head off possible U.S. measures to curb China's sales to that market.\nSun expressed hope that the visit next week by U.S. Vice President Al Gore would help develop mutual trust, and he hinted the trip might coincide with the signing of some major contracts.\n\"I would not exclude the possibility of the signing of some contracts,\" he told reporters.\nHe added that a deal for the sale of Boeing aircraft to China was among the possibilities though the companies involved needed to agree on terms.\n\"We will continue to encourage our enterprises to expand imports from the United States,\" Sun said.\nHe made his remarks one day after Washington announced China's trade surplus with the United States rose to $3.72 billion in January from $2.74 billion in January last year.\nWashington says China had a surplus of nearly $40 billion with the United States for all of last year while Beijing puts the figure at $10 billion.\nChina does not count shipments through Hong Kong and the White Paper addressed this issue by saying that both American and Chinese experts agreed those goods had an average of 40 percent added value in Hong Kong.\nThat meant the U.S. version of the trade imbalance was overstated, according to the White Paper.\nThe paper pointed out that much of the trade surplus was from China's processing of raw materials from other regions, meaning that other countries were in fact benefiting from the trade as well.\nChina was also providing low-cost production that had been done in Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong in the past, and was not taking jobs away from American workers.\nSun said U.S. companies had lost out on major infrastructure contracts, particularly in the electric power sector, because of a lack of government export financing, and he called for more support from the U.S. Export-Import Bank.\nWashington had thwarted its own prospects in the nuclear power sector because of restrictions on nuclear technology exports to China.\n\"The U.S. export control policies and lingering sanctions against China have greatly restricted U.S. exports to China as well as U.S. investments in high-tech sectors,\" the White Paper said.\nSun noted that China had reduced its import duties sharply in recent years and that further cuts would bring the average rate to 15 percent by the year 2000 from 23 percent now.\n","176":"China has vowed to wind up the lengthy probe of the disgraced former boss of Beijing, saying the case had seriously damaged the Communist Party in the nation's capital.\nBeijing party chief Chen Xitong stepped down in April last year, only weeks after his protege and vice-mayor Wang Baosen was targeted in a probe of economic crimes and committed suicide.\n\"The cases of Chen and Wang absolutely will not just fade away,\" the Outlook magazine quoted Beijing's current party chief, Wei Jianxing, as saying.\n\"These cases have had a very bad effect on municipal affairs.. and have destroyed a number of comrades in the party,\" it quoted Wei -- the Communist Party's top graft fighter -- as saying.\nThe weekly magazine, published by the official Xinhua news agency, carried the remarks in its latest edition, seen in Beijing on Wednesday.\nThe 66-year-old Chen has been out of the public eye since his fall from grace, becoming the most prominent victim of a campaign against corruption.\nHe was deprived of his seat on the party's powerful Politburo and was officially said to be under investigation for \"serious mistakes\".\nUnpublished party documents say that Chen, who ran Beijing for 12 years, first as mayor and then as party chief, had abused his office by amassing $24 million in unauthorised funds and lavishing favours on friends, associates and a long-time mistress.\nVice-mayor Wang was found to have used his position to obtain 116 houses illegally and built himself a villa on the outskirts of the city. He also masterminded a $37 million embezzlement and graft scam, officials have said.\nThe inability of investigators to announce a conclusion to their investigation had triggered much speculation, particularly in the case of Chen who was said to be refusing to cooperate and was threatening to implicate others.\nIt also contrasted sharply with the speedy trial and sentencing last week of dissident Wang Dan, who was jailed for 11 years on subversion charges after less than four hours in a Beijing courtroom.\nThe magazine also said that 22 people had been linked to the probe of the late vice-mayor, including Zhou Beifang, the former chairman of Hong Kong listed affiliates of a major Chinese steel company, and Chen Xitong's secretary, Chen Jian.\nEarlier this month, prosecutors filed corruption charges against 30 people, including Zhou, who was detained in February last year.\nThe magazine also said that a former senior member of the Beijing city assembly, Tie Ying, had been arrested and expelled from the party earlier this year for accepting a large bribe from a Hong Kong businessman. It did not give further details.\nThe city government had been virtually paralysed since the disgrace of Chen and Wang, Chinese sources have said.\nThe campaign to clean up the Beijing administration was widely believed to have been a factor in the departure last week of Li Qiyan as mayor.\nCorruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.\nCommunist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus that threatened the party.\nCourts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases.\n","177":"Three time-bombs planted on buses blew up in rapid succession in China's restive far west, killing at least four people and shattering the nation's calm in the delicate aftermath of the death of patriarch Deng Xiaoping.\nPolice patrolled streets and checked suspicious bags and packages on Wednesday in Urumqi, capital of the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang, following the blasts in the city on Tuesday afternoon.\n\"I think at least four to five people were killed, including one child who died instantly,\" said a Xinjiang television station official, who declined to be identified.\nThe blasts, which officials said wounded at least 60, occurred within minutes in separate parts of the city, which is the centre of Chinese control over the region and its ethnic Uighur population.\n\"People are full of fear, and the city is on high alert,\" the TV station official said.\nIt was the first violence reported in Xinjiang, a region that Moslem separatists call East Turkestan, since anti-Chinese riots in Yining on February 5 and 6 left nine people dead.\nNo one has claimed responsibility for Tuesday's blasts. Xinjiang, bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states, was shaken last year by attacks on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.\nChinese leaders have expressed concern over the threat from Islamic fundamentalism, visiting Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said in Beijing.\n\"I think we have a very similar view on this,\" he said.\n\"Every attempt to turn religion into a weapon becomes extremely dangerous, it is something that knows no boundaries,\" Levy said. \"It is like sand, it can be transported by the wind from one place to to another.\"\nTuesday's bombs exploded at around 6.40 p.m. (1040 GMT). \"People in Urumqi usually finish work at seven, so not too many people were injured or killed,\" the TV official said.\nUrumqi residents recounted Tuesday's few minutes of terror.\n\"The Number 44 bus exploded near the agricultural bank,\" said a young Uighur woman. \"A trishaw driver was killed, he was lying on the ground covered with blood.\n\"All the windows of the bus were broken. Several minutes later, police sealed the spot. Policemen, riot police and armed police could be seen everywhere,\" she added.\n\"Residents were ordered to stay at home or at their (work) units. We are terrified. Many people go to work by taxi or buses provided by the units,\" she said.\nAnother bomb wrecked a Number Two bus, tearing off the roof. The third explosion was on a Number 10 bus, but no details were available.\n\"When I heard the explosion, I felt as if the sky had collapsed,\" said a Uighur witness. \"Many people in a store rushed out to look. I was too terrified to go out.\n\"Today buses are running again, but there are policemen at every station, they check people and bags,\" the witness said.\n\"I hate the people making the explosions. Our life is much better than before. I don't understand why they destroy stability and make trouble for ordinary people.\nNumber Two buses have been a target before.\n\"This kind of explosion happened in 1992, I think, as the Number Two bus runs on the major route through downtown,\" said a bus station worker.\nThe explosions occurred as final rites were being observed in far-off Beijing for Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who strictly enforced the integrity of China against separatist threats.\n","178":"China's leaders have agreed on a need to stimulate the economy but the central bank is trying to keep the policy low-key, a senior Chinese economist said on Thursday.\n\"There is a broad consensus on a need to stimulate the economy,\" said Fan Gang, an economist and director of the China Reform Foundation, an authoritative think-tank.\n\"But the central bank wants to keep this low-key,\" he told reporters in a broad-ranging discussion of China's economic policy.\nChina has largely relaxed its three-year programme of economic austerity aimed at wringing inflation out of the economy.\nRetail price inflation had reached a worrisome 21.7 percent in 1994 but was brought down to 14.8 percent last year.\nIn September this year it fell to 5.0 percent, well within the government target of 10 percent for the full year.\nAt the same time, economic growth has managed to reach about 9.0 percent, though Fan said that a build-up of inventories -- some of that unsaleable -- probably accounted for about 1.5 percentage points of economic growth.\nThe central bank, the People's Bank of China, has cut interest rates twice this year, partly as a response to the marked gains in bringing inflation under control.\nThe People's Bank was also trying to lend a helping hand to ailing state industry, which has been saddled with heavy interest payments on its huge debts.\nCentral bank officials have said that the interest rate cuts did not mean a loosening of monetary policy, and that they would keep policy \"appropriately tight\".\n\"Central bank officials want to keep the word 'tight' in the policy,\" said Fan, adding that they did not want to see a renewed surge of government spending that would once again pump up inflation.\nHe said, however, that there still were controls on fixed investment that could be eased somewhat.\n\"The central government needs to accelerate growth without overheating,\" he said. \"We need the highest growth possible.\"\nThe economist said there was still plenty of idle capacity in the state sector with many of the employees of state industry on leave from their jobs on partial pay because of a lack of orders.\nMuch of that was concentrated in the nation's \"rust bowl\" in the northeast, a bastion of heavy industry that has relied on central planning and been unable to upgrade its antiquated equipment and shed its huge payrolls of excess workers.\n\"From the point of view of reform, higher growth makes (reform of state industry) easier,\" he said\nMuch of China's creaking state industry needed to cut surplus labour to become more efficient, Fan said, although he conceded that this was still a politically sensitive issue.\n\"Social stability is still a big factor,\" he said.\n","179":"At least two bombs rocked the western Chinese city of Urumqi on Tuesday, killing one person and injuring at least 60, officials and residents said.\nThe blasts, on the day that China held memorial rites for its late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, occurred on city buses in at least two separate incidents in the capital of the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang at about 6.30 p.m. (1030 GMT).\nDeng died last Wednesday aged 92 and Tuesday was the final of six days of mourning for him.\n\"At least 60 people were killed or injured,\" a local government official, who declined to be further identified, said.\nHe did not say how many were killed.\nBut a resident of the city said a trishaw driver was killed in one incident when a passenger in a bus found a bomb under a seat and threw it out of the window. The number of injuries from that explosion was not known.\nThere were conflicting reports of a third bomb.\nA police officer at a centre handling the incidents declined to give further details, saying only: \"The situation is very tense.\"\nAn official at the Military Region General Hospital in Urumqi, capital of the restive western region of Xinjiang, said at least 37 injured had been admitted after the bomb blasts. She gave no further details.\nAt another hospital in Urumqi, an official said two people who had been slightly injured had been treated and released.\nA woman working at a hotel near one explosion said the blast ripped apart a bus and sent bits of metal flying through the air.\nPolice arrived shortly afterwards and cordoned off the area. Soldiers on trucks were later brought into the city, she said.\nOne explosion occurred on Northwest Road, involving a vehicle believed to be a minibus, a worker at a nearby hotel said.\nAsked if anyone was killed, the worker said: \"What do you think? With many people on the bus the chance is very high.\"\nNearby residents contacted by telephone said traffic was snarled along the road for about one hour and that people were being advised to avoid the area.\nThe explosions were believed to involve time-bombs, possibly set by members of the ethnic Uighur minority, officials said.\n\"We suspect that these incidents involve splittist elements,\" said one official, referring to pro-indepenence activists among Xinjiang's native Uighur population.\n\"These people want to disrupt the atmosphere during the memorial ceremonies for comrade Deng Xiaoping,\" said another official, referring to final rites held in Beijing on Tuesday morning for China's late paramount leader.\nNo arrests had yet been made, officials said.\n\"People have been warned not to go outside,\" one resident said.\nIt was the first violence reported in Xinjiang since anti-Chinese riots in the far western region's town of Yining on February 5 and 6 left nine people dead and 198 injured.\nChinese police arrested up to 300 people after that riot in Xinjiang -- a region that Moslem separatists call East Turkestan -- but many have been released after interrogation.\nAbout 1,000 people, mostly Uighur farmers or unemployed young men, rioted in Yining in one of the largest and most violent demonstrations for independence in Xinjiang -- which means New Frontier in Chinese -- since the communist takeover in 1949.\nXinjiang, bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states, was shaken last year by bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.\n","180":"China's President Jiang Zemin granted a rare meeting to members of the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday in a campaign aimed at boosting ties with the American Congress.\nA beaming Jiang was shown on state television receiving the 22 representatives -- the biggest U.S. congressional delegation ever to visit China.\n\"Improving Sino-U.S. relations and developing them on a healthy basis is in the interests of both countries,\" he said. \"I had very good discussions with President (Bill) Clinton in Manila in November and we reached some important understandings.\n\"The Chinese side is willing to grasp the present opportunities and, along with the United States, to reduce difficulties between our two countries.\"\nBeijing and Washington have been trying to mend ties that were badly strained by a series of disputes over the past two years ranging from Taiwan to trade and human rights.\nIn Manila, Jiang and Clinton agreed on an exchange of presidential visits in 1997 and 1998 that would be the first since President George Bush came to China in early 1989.\nAnalysts said China's communist leadership -- and Jiang in particular -- were eager to boost ties with the Congress, fearing that Beijing had suffered by relying too heavily on its links to the U.S. administration in the past.\nThey noted that the Beijing believes it was led astray by administration assurances that Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui would not be permitted to visit the United States in 1995.\nCongress pushed hard for Lee and the landmark private visit was eventually allowed to proceed, a decision that enraged Beijing.\nChina turned its anger on the island, which it considers a rebel province, first breaking off a semi-official channel for talks with Taipei and later holding missile tests near the island in March last year.\nJim Kolbe, the Arizona Republican who is leading the congressional delegation, told reporters shortly before his meeting with Jiang on Tuesday that Chinese leaders had recognised the need for contacts with Congress.\n\"The Chinese are becoming much more skilled and have much more contact\" with Congress, he said.\nMembers of the congressional group told reporters that human rights had come up in discussions with other Chinese officials and would be raised during the meeting with Jiang.\nJiang met a U.S. Senate group led by minority leader Tom Daschle last November.\nJiang, who is known to be fond of Western pop songs, was said to have entertained that group with some of his repertoire. It was unknown if the Kolbe delegation would be treated to the same welcome.\n","181":"China is expected to unveil a cautious budget this weekend, avoiding bold but risky moves in 1997, the crucial year of the recovery of Hong Kong and a major meeting of the Communist Party elite, economists said on Friday.\nThe 1997 budget would again show a hefty deficit although it could be smaller than the 61.442 billion yuan ($7.4 billion) estimate for 1996, they said.\n\"This should be a year for a steady-as-she-goes budget,\" said a foreign diplomat who follows economic issues.\nFinance Minister Liu Zhongli is expected to announce the budget to the National People's Congress, or parliament, on Sunday or Monday.\nThe recovery of the British colony of Hong Kong at midnight on June 30 and the scheduling of the Communist Party congress for later in the year will most likely ensure cautious fiscal policies, economists said.\nBeijing wants to see the Hong Kong handover proceed smoothly and its leaders have little inclination to take risks ahead of the congress which will set policies and decide who gets the top jobs for the next five years. Beijing's leaders also have an added reason for caution as they can no longer rely on the steadying hand of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who died this month.\n\"I am not looking for anything startling in the budget,\" said another foreign diplomat.\nEven if the deficit is not reduced this year, it will still be manageable. Last year's deficit was only 0.99 percent of estimated 1996 gross domestic product.\nEconomists said they expected to see higher tax revenues this year as China's economy grows at a steady pace and tax collection improves.\nChina has already forecast economic growth of 10.5 percent for the year, up from 9.7 percent recorded in 1996. Premier Li Peng on Saturday is to set a yet more cautious goal of 8.0 percent growth.\nState revenues expanded 18.1 percent in the first 11 months of last year, and economists said more efficient tax collection and better management of state finances were key factors.\nInflation will also be relatively modest this year, limiting upward pressure on government spending. Retail price inflation is forecast at less than the 6.1 percent of 1996.\nDespite lower interest rates, Beijing will need to meet increased payments of interest and principal on past debts, said economist Li Yang, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n\"This will mean more bonds will be issued this year,\" he said.\nEconomists said, however, this was not a major concern as it was largely in line with China's efforts to issue more tradeable debt to create an active secondary market and strengthen its financial sector.\nBut a cautious budget will mean China cannot afford to make deep cuts in subsidies to ailing state industry in 1997.\nMany overstaffed state companies badly need to shed workers from their payrolls but Beijing's leaders are fearful this could lead to social unrest.\nEconomists will also be watching the military budget closely, where further increases in spending are expected.\nDeng's chosen successor, President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, needs the support of the army to retain his grip on power.\nIn his eulogy for Deng, Jiang referred to the army as the \"pillar of the state\".\nChina has said it wants to reduce the size of its three-million-strong army but it is likely to more than offset savings with stepped up spending on advanced weaponry, analysts said.\n","182":"China has taken its cue from U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan and tried to talk its raging stock markets lower but some investors said Beijing regulators did not need to shout.\nChina's official People's Daily ran a front-page commentary on Monday calling on investors to behave rationally in investing in the market, warning that what goes up must come down.\nThe commentary, carried prominently in major financial newspapers as well, also reminded the investing public that the safest place to put its money was in the bank.\nMany Chinese officials and stock market brokers noted similarities to Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's now famous remarks this month about \"irrational exuberance\" of U.S. markets.\nGreenspan's remarks, which did not specifically mention stocks, were clear enough to send share markets around the globe into a steep, if brief, fall. Since then many investors have remained cautious.\n\"There were definite similarities in approach,\" said a stock market policy official who declined to be identified.\n\"They (regulators) are looking at the same objectives -- the stock markets were too high and they hoped the markets would move lower,\" he said.\nA spokeswoman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission chuckled over the suggestion that Greenspan might have inspired Beijing's action.\n\"Our objective was to bring some stability to the market,\" she said without elaborating.\nWhatever the objective, many brokers and investors were not entirely sympathetic with the result.\n\"The phrasing (of the commentary) was much too tough,\" said an angry broker in Shenzhen, home of one of the nation's two officially approved stock markets.\n\"This was over the top,\" he said.\nThe commentary called up images of Wall Street's 1929 crash while it lashed out at big investors for manipulating the market and blamed brokers for improperly extending overdrafts to finance stock purchases.\nThe state media also came under criticism for helping to pump up the market by urging investors to buy shares.\nLast week, the bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen in southern China slapped curbs on share movements, limiting them to a daily 10 percent in either direction.\nShenzhen's A share market for domestic investors fell the 10 percent limit on Monday, sliding 46.34 points to 417.2 while Shanghai's A share market lost 9.92 percent, or 115.37 points, to 1,047.68.\nThe B share indices, which track shares supposedly reserved for foreign investors, closely mirrored the A share falls.\nBoth Shenzhen and Shanghai had seen huge run-ups in share prices this year, with most of the gains made in recent months. Shenzhen had surged 360 percent from a trough to the peak this month, while Shanghai had climbed about 150 percent.\nSome brokers were sympathetic to the plight of regulators.\n\"The market was clearly very speculative,\" said a Beijing-based broker. \"I disagree with some people over how far ahead of itself the market actually was but there was bound to be a considerable pyschological impact from any action by the regulators.\"\nBrokers said that part of the reason behind the steep rise was the lack of alternative investments.\nTwo interest rate cuts this year had played a key role in luring money into the stock market.\n","183":"China needs $20 billion in foreign investment for its power expansion projects through 2000 and its investment climate is strong enough to attract this amount, Chinese power officials said on Monday.\nThey also denied that there was a firm cap on investment returns in the power industry though they conceded that the best rate on key projects was slightly below 17 percent.\n\"We will need about $100 billion in investment in power during the ninth five-year plan (1996-2000),\" said Zhao Xizheng, vice minister of Electric Power.\n\"About 20 percent of the total will be from foreign investment,\" he told reporters at an energy conference sponsored by China and the European Union, adding that the rest would be shared equally by the central and local governments.\n\"We think we can reach this goal,\" he said.\nSome foreign businessmen have complained that China was setting a ceiling of 15 percent returns on investment and that this was too low.\nAsked whether there was a 15 percent ceiling on investment returns for foreigners, Zhao replied: \"We have never said there was a 15 percent cap on investment.\"\nForeign businessmen have said that India and Pakistan offered better returns in the power sector.\n\"You must look at the level of risk,\" said another Chinese official. \"China is more reliable.\"\nOther Chinese power officials said that the investment return was set on a case by case basis, taking into account financing costs, risk controls and budgetary considerations.\n\"We don't cap investment returns,\" said Tan Aixing, director general of the Ministry of Electric Power's department of international cooperation.\nHe told reporters that the highest return on a central government-approved project -- nearly 17 percent -- was for a power station in Zhuhai in south China.\nA Hong Kong consortium including Hutchison Whampoa Ltd and Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd, has a 45 percent stake in the plant.\nForeign investors can obtain higher returns than this on smaller projects that do not have to be reviewed by central government authorities.\nProjects for less than $30 million can be approved by local governments and often offer more attractive terms, officials said.\n","184":"A Chinese ideologue known for his strictly orthodox Marxist views denied on Tuesday that he was the author of two essays critical of China's reforms.\nDeng Liqun, 81, a former Communist Party propaganda chief and secretary to Chairman Mao Zedong, said the author of two articles that have become known as \"The 10,000 Word Essay\" was Li Yanming.\n\"I didn't write the essay, it was Li Yanming,\" Deng told reporters. He did not further identify Li Yanming and gave no Asked whether he supported Li's views in \"The 10,000 Word Essay\" that has sparked widespread behind-the-scenes debate, he smiled and shrugged and said: \"He wrote what was on his mind.\"\nDeng was attending an economic summit in Beijing that was assessing the business climate in China, with a heavy emphasis on the successes of the reform programme launched in 1979 by Deng Xiaoping to eliminate stultifying Stalinist-style planning in favour of market forces.\nAsked if he agreed with issues under debate at the conference, Deng adopted the officially-sanctioned public party line: \"Of course. China is a very big country, it has a lot of potential but it also has a lot of problems to be solved.\"\nSeveral of the speakers at the conference called for tougher efforts to reform China's ailing state-owned enterprises, which \"The 10,000 Word Essay\" warns are suffering at the expense of private enterprise.\nChina's propaganda tsars recently suspended a magazine and banned articles by a leading bankruptcy expert after a lengthy behind-doors debate on the essay erupted into the public eye.\nThe ban prompted an open letter by a writer in Beijing questioning whether China's propaganda officials were opposed to economic reform and whether they backed the leadership of state president and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin.\nThe Press and Publications Administration, under the party's powerful Propaganda Department, suspended publication of the Economic Work Monthly, based in southwestern Guizhou province, in August, said sources familiar with the magazine.\nThe suspension followed the magazine's publication of an article critical of the privately circulated 10,000-word essay, which also urges a return to the class struggle espoused by Mao.\nWestern diplomats and Chinese analysts have described a literary and cultural freeze in recent months amid a crackdown by propaganda tsars on publications and authors that dare to break away from a stultifying diet of state-approved fare.\nThe president of the outspoken Beijing Youth Daily is to be replaced soon by a more conservative editor.\nThe clampdown has been fuelled by a call for \"spiritual civilisation\" -- a communist watchword for orthodox Marxist values -- as the theme for a party plenum scheduled for later this month, the analysts said.\nParty chief Jiang is said to have distanced himself from the essay at the annual session of the National People's Congress, or parliament, last March, when he reportedly said: \"Some people say I support the 10,000-word essay, isn't that underestimating me too much?\"\n","185":"China is preparing to tap overseas capital markets by listing shares of one or two of its chemical companies abroad, a senior Chinese official was quoted as saying on Sunday.\nBut as Beijing looks for foreign capital to upgrade its technology it plans to tighten foreign access to its own chemicals market by adding new restrictions on joint ventures.\nChemical Industry Minister Gu Xiulian told the Business Weekly that one or two chemical companies were getting ready for share offerings abroad, though she did not name the companies or the exchanges.\nShe also said that one or two Chinese companies would issue convertible bonds -- bonds convertible into stock -- on a trial basis, though regulatory guidelines were not yet in place.\nChina securities regulators are known to be preparing another batch of companies for share offers outside the country. It was unclear from Gu's remarks whether the chemical firms would be among those companies.\nTianjin Bohai Chemical Group already has a listing on the Hong Kong stock market as well as on the Shanghai exchange while Jilin Chemical Industrial trades in Hong Kong and New York as well as on China's southern bourse in Shenzhen.\nGu said that China's chemical industry needed to raise funds to make technical upgradings and that stock and bond offerings would help reach these goals.\n\"We are trying to achieve the shift to a quality, intensive mode (of production) from the quantity, extensive model with the aid of foreign capital,\" she said.\nChina will bar foreign companies from holding controlling stakes in joint ventures with big state enterprises in priority areas such as in soda ash and \"sensitive materials\".\nThere was no indication of when the move might go into effect, and the policy \"does not mean we are totally opposed to stock control by foreign businesses\", Gu said.\nGu had previously told reporters that China was planning to review its policies towards joint ventures in the chemical industry.\nShe had suggested that areas where new technology was vital to the development of domestic industry, foreign companies would be allowed to control joint ventures.\nBut other areas where China had already developed sufficient expertise would be closed to more than 50 percent foreign ownership.\nChina is particularly encouraging direct foreign investment in fertilisers, ethylene, synthetic materials as well as fine chemical products -- either as wholly owned or jointly owned operations, Gu told the newspaper.\nShe also criticised the \"westernisation\" of well known domestic products, saying that China needed an integration of foreign brands and domestic products.\n","186":"China hit back on Tuesday at U.S. accusations of human rights abuses, saying Washington was distorting facts while turning a blind eye to problems in its own back yard.\nIn a lengthy riposte to U.S. State Department criticism of China in its annual report on human rights, Beijing described the United States as a land of guns, terrorist bomb attacks and racial discrimination.\nChina's angry attack, carried by the official Xinhua news agency and titled: \"A Look at the U.S. Human Rights Record\", also said American-style political democracy was a game of the rich and faulted the U.S. constitution for providing inadequate guarantees.\nThe U.S. report, released in January, accused Beijing of effectively silencing public dissent in 1996 through jailings, intimidation or exile.\nChina said the State Department was \"once again distorting and attacking at length the state of human rights in China and more than 190 other countries and regions\".\n\"The U.S. government, posing as the 'human rights judge of the world', turned a blind eye yet again to the serious human rights problems in its own country,\" Xinhua said.\n\"There are 220 million firearms in private hands, which translates into nearly one gun per person,\" it said. \"Armed criminals are on the rampage, shootings are non-stop and a large number of innocent people have fallen prey to violence.\"\nXinhua cited the deadly 1993 World Trade Centre bombing in New York, the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City and the explosion during the Olympic Games in Atlanta last year as symptoms of America's deep-rooted problems.\n\"It is not accidental that terrorist bomb attacks continuously occur in the United States, an excessively violent country where terrorism is deeply rooted in society.\"\nThe news agency said the United States had one of the world's largest police forces relative to its population and the largest prison population.\nThe report described crowded U.S. prisons as places where \"prison guards mounted on horseback keep watch on inmates as though they are herding animals\".\n\"Inmates are sometimes forced to fight among themselves and are whipped\".\nIt condemned pervasive racial discrimination, saying blacks and other ethnic minorities had always been second-class citizens.\nThe agency went on to say the United States had a less than exemplary record abroad, inflicting human rights violations on other nations through wars and acts of aggression throughout its history.\n\"We strongly advise the U.S. government to put its own house in order before pointing its finger at other countries,\" it said.\n","187":"European Commission Vice President Sir Leon Brittan suggested on Thursday that China might soon see progress on its plan to join the World Trade Organisation but Beijing played down chances of a breakthrough.\nBrittan said he might press the United States to move forward on China's drive to join the WTO if Beijing would give an assurance that it supported the European position.\n\"I will certainly take up the matter with the Americans with extreme urgency ... urging them that the time has come to adopt the approach that Europe has pioneered,\" he told a business conference in the Chinese capital.\n\"I hope even before the end of this visit to be able to announce some specific action\" in advancing the process, he said.\nEurope has maintained that it would be flexible on requirements for China's full implementation of WTO rules. But Beijing had to make clear its commitment to full compliance and show progress on granting access to its domestic markets.\nChina's Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi on Thursday appeared to be unconvinced that the United States, which has been a key hurdle to Beijing's drive to join the global trade organisation, was ready to change its stance.\n\"Their intentions are kind-hearted,\" said Wu in a reference to the European effort. \"But the question of China's accession to the World Trade Organisation is not entirely decided by the European Union,\" she told reporters at the same business conference.\nBeijing has been pushing to join the WTO under the more lenient terms of developing nation status but Washington has insisted that China's economy is too big for such treatment.\nBrittan, who is leading a delegation of 30 European business leaders hoping to tap into the Chinese market, said he would meet senior Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and foreign trade minister Wu.\nBrittan made it clear that a reaffirmation of Chinese acceptance of the European position would be enough for him to try to take his case to the United States.\n\"The U.S. was erecting very high hurdles to be surmounted,\" he said of the American position.\nBut he said the end of the U.S. presidential election campaign could be an opportunity for making progress in the negotiations.\n\"Recent stirrings in the media...suggest that the U.S. is perhaps readier now than over the past two years to heed European calls for decisive engagement on this negotiation,\" Brittan said.\nBrittan praised China for making strides in strengthening intellectual property rights though he said more market access was needed.\nHe also warned that Europe would not be discriminated against in the Chinese market, and he singled out bilateral shipping agreements as an area of concern.\n\"Europe cannot accept unequal treatment and will not be discriminated against,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday, Chinese leaders denounced Beijing's exclusion from the WTO as unjust, saying the world's largest developing nation had made great strides in opening its markets to trade and investment.\nBeijing also lashed out on Thursday at European Union investigations into Chinese textile exports, hinting at retaliatory measures if the probes led to anti-dumping measures.\n","188":"China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Friday dismissed British opposition to Beijing's plans to disband Hong Kong's legislature and said it would not affect the smooth transfer of power in the territory this year.\n\"The British side's opposition to this is an overreaction and unreasonable and unnecessary,\" Qian told reporters.\n\"... if they (British authorities) continue to voice their opposition to the operation of the provisional Legislative Council I don't think it will have any impact on the smooth transition of Hong Kong,\" he said.\nHong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, becoming a Special Administrative Region of China after 150 years of British rule.\nBeijing has pledged to allow Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the transfer of power.\nChina has said it will scrap Hong Kong's existing elected Legislative Council and install an appointed provisional body in a move opposed by Britain as well as the United States.\nQian, who is also a vice-premier, conceded that foreign countries had commercial interests in Hong Kong but that did not give them the right to inferfere in the territory's affairs after the handover.\n\"No foreign country has the right to interfere in the affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,\" he said, repeating Beijing's long-standing position.\nQian also held out the prospect of legislators who lost seats in Hong Kong being able to run for posts in China's parliament, the National People's Congress.\nHe said, however, they would have to recognise the Chinese constitution and accept China's procedures for choosing delegates.\nChina's parliament has little real power and its main task is to approve laws drafted by the Communist Party.\nIt has nearly 3,000 delegates and Hong Kong will be entitled to only 36 of those seats next year.\n","189":"China is on target with plans to to promote 100 large chemical groups by 2000 by tapping a $1.6 billion war chest, Minister of Chemical Industry Gu Xiulian said on Friday.\nThe industry hoped that 10 of the groups, which are being groomed to compete in the export market, could eventually list their shares either on domestic or foreign stock exchanges, she said.\n\"Currently, we have 13.6 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) to support development plans,\" Gu told reporters. \"Some of this was made available under the previous five-year plan (1991-1995). All of the money is to support development projects.\"\nChina has been trying to promote big companies to give its ailing state sector a more competitive edge.\n\"One of the problems in the industry is that we've had too much small-scale production which was protected under central planning. But now we have a market economy,\" Gu said.\nThe government aimed to build up companies which could each export $10 million worth of chemicals a year. There were now 80 such companies, she added.\nAsked about plans to publicly list the firms, Gu did not name any company or group but said the ministry's policy was to support companies ready to go public.\nListing plans would then require approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, China's top securities watchdog.\nChemical companies Tianjin Bohai Chemical Industry (Group) Co Ltd and Jilin Chemical Industry Co Ltd are some of the companies listed in China and abroad.\nGu said some of the state-run chemical companies were among the firms losing money, and that subsidiaries were needed to offset rising raw material costs. She did not mention any companies by name but said chemical fertilisers were one area where subsidiaries were necessary.\n","190":"The Communist Party boss of China's restive Xinjiang region said on Friday a tiny handful of separatists was behind a series of recent bombings but most had been caught and the region was stable.\nHe also denied that hundreds of people had been killed in unrest in Xinjiang.\n\"Only an extremely small number of people were involved in these acts of terrorism,\" said Xinjiang party chief Wang Lequan in response to a reporter's question on the unrest.\n\"Most of the criminals have already been caught.\"\nWang, flanked by the entire leadership of the largely Moslem region, did not give any figures for the number of arrests or deaths.\nWang was speaking at a briefing for reporters and government officials on a trade fair planned for the far northwestern region later this year.\n\"This does not mean Xinjiang is not stable,\" he said. \"Investors should not be unduly concerned.\"\nThree bombs went off on public buses in the region's capital Urumqi last month in an attack apparently timed to coincide with funeral rites in Beijing for China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\nNine people were killed and 74 wounded.\nExiled ethnic Uighurs, who want to set up an independent state of \"East Turkestan\" in Xinjiang, have claimed responsibility for the bombings and vowed to stage more attacks until they had gained complete freedom for their homeland.\nThe Turkic-speaking Uighurs are Xinjiang's largest Moslem group. Relations with Han Chinese settlers have been uneasy and marked by sporadic outbreaks of violence. China is predominantly Han.\nThe bus bombings in Urumqi followed an anti-Chinese riot in early February in the city of Yining, about 50 km (30 miles) east of Xinjiang's border with Kazakhstan. Chinese officials said nine people were killed and 198 injured in that incident.\nWang described the Yining unrest as an act of subversion that also stemmed from a small group of people.\n\"This was quelled very quickly,\" he said.\nAsked to comment on a report that hundreds of people, both Uighur and Han Chinese, had died in the aftermath of that incident, he said: \"There is no truth to this.\"\nOther officials said the incidents had not disrupted trade with neighbouring Central Asian states or other areas.\n\"The roads to Kazakhstan and other areas are open,\" said Li Donghui, Xinjiang's vice governor.\n\"Our trade overall was up 80 percent in the first two months of the year. Border trade rose 50 percent.\"\nOfficials also said the incidents had not affected stability in other parts of the country.\nTwo bombs went off in Beijing last week. One of the attacks killed two people and wounded about 30, sources have said.\nPolice and other officials have said there was no evidence linking those bombings with unrest in Xinjiang.\nBut taxi drivers in the Chinese capital have said they were asked not to give rides to suspicious looking people from Xinjiang and to be especially cautious in neighbourhoods where many Uighur migrants live.\n","191":"An unemployed Taiwanese journalist on Monday doused himself with petrol aboard a Taiwan airliner and hijacked the plane to China where he requested political asylum, officials said.\nThe Boeing 757 airliner, carrying 150 passengers and six crew, was on its way back to Taiwan after landing safely in the southeastern city of Xiamen.\nChinese police said the suspect, identified by Taiwan as Liu Shan-chung, 45, was being held in Xiamen for questioning.\n\"The hijacker wants political asylum,\" an airport official said by telephone.\nAn executive of Far East Air Transport, the operator of the hijacked Taiwanese airliner, told reporters the man who forced Flight 128 to fly to China said he faced political repression in Taiwan.\n\"The hijacker told the captain 'I am a victim of political repression',\" said Lee Yun-ning, general manager of Far East Air Transport, speaking in Taipei.\nTaiwan demanded China return the suspect, saying it had the right to put him on trial.\n\"We have legal jurisdiction,\" Taiwan Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao said hours after the plane crossed the Taiwan Strait and touched down in Xiamen. \"The mainland authorities should return the hijacker immediately.\"\nChinese officials did not say how they would deal with the suspect.\nHijacking is a capital offence but commandeering an aircraft from China's arch rival Taiwan would be determined by political considerations as well as legal guidelines, lawyers said.\nChina and Taiwan have been rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 when the Nationalists fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the communists.\nThe Taiwan airliner was on a scheduled flight from the island's southern city of Kaohsiung to Taipei when it changed course and headed for the China mainland.\nLiu had doused himself with petrol and forced the pilot to change course, Taiwanese authorities said.\nLiu worked briefly as a journalist for the east Taiwan newspaper Lientung Daily after being fired a year ago from Kaohsiung's The Commons Daily for discipline problems, his former employers said.\nIn Taiwan, Defence Minister Chiang Chung-ling said four Taiwan fighters had scrambled into an escort formation and tailed the plane part of the way across the Taiwan Strait.\nTaiwan defence officials decided not to intercept the flight to avoid a military \"misunderstanding\" with China's People's Liberation Army, a defence official told Reuters.\nThe last hijacking of a Taiwanese airliner to China was in May 1986, when the pilot of a Boeing 747 cargo plane owned by Taiwan's flag carrier China Airlines commandeered the jet and flew it to Guangzhou.\nBeijing returned the plane and two crew members who did not want to stay in China after talks between the two rivals in Hong Kong.\nChina endured a rash of 12 hijackings in 1993 and 1994 by Chinese who ordered pilots to fly them to Taiwan for political asylum.\nAir piracy fell off sharply after Beijing launched a major drive to improve what had been lax security at most airports.\n","192":"Premier Li Peng said on Friday China wanted a swift end to a crisis surrounding a senior North Korean defector sheltering in South Korea's mission in Beijing.\nLi gave little hint as to how the month-long standoff would end, although he said stability on the tense Korean peninsula was a key consideration.\n\"I can tell you conditions are nearly ripe for solving this problem,\" Li told reporters when asked about progress in negotiations on the fate of Hwang Jang-yop, who has sought refuge in Seoul's Beijing consulate.\nChina wanted to \"appropriately solve this problem at an early date\", he told a news conference at Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People.\n\"On this question, China will exercise caution and we will handle the issue by proceeding from the maintenance of peace on the Korean peninsula,\" Li said.\n\"Of course, we will consider the positions of all sides,\" he said.\nHwang, a senior ideological theoretician and top aide to supreme leader Kim Jong-il, has been stranded in the consular compound since February 12 while China and North and South Korea negotiate his fate.\nHe is the most senior official to defect from the isolated Stalinist state.\nHe has said he wants to be allowed to go to South Korea and foreign diplomats have said that he would likely be allowed to leave for a third country first and then travel to Seoul.\nThe defection on Chinese territory has deeply embarrassed Beijing, forcing it to chose between its old communist ally of North Korea and its new capitalist friend in the South.\nChina and North Korea fought side by side in the 1950-53 Korean War but Beijing has drawn closer to South Korea as it pushes ahead with rapid development under market-style economic reforms.\nLi repeated Beijing's position that it had jurisdiction since Hwang asked for asylum while he was in Beijing.\nHe said China would follow international practice in solving the dispute but he made the somewhat surprising remark that there was no automatic right to asylum as far as Beijing was concerned.\n\"China does not recognise the right of diplomatic asylum by foreign embassies or consulates in its territory,\" he said.\nBeijing has, however, allowed asylum seekers to leave foreign embassies on its soil in the past.\nDissident Fang Lizhi sought shelter in the U.S. embassy in Beijing shortly after the army crackdown on dissent in June 1989. He was eventually allowed to leave for the United States.\n","193":"China said on Monday it had not made contributions to the U.S. Democratic Party to influence American policy and the visit by U.S. Vice President Al Gore had no link to improper payments.\nThe official People's Daily also pointed an accusing finger at Taiwan for stirring up accusations of Chinese involvement to try to shift blame from itself.\n\"The Chinese government is not involved in the so-called 'political contributions scandal' in the slightest way and is entirely free of guilt,\" said the newspaper in a signed commentary.\nThe Washington Post has reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned six members of Congress last year that they had been targeted by China to receive illegal campaign contributions from foreign corporations.\n\"The development of Sino-U.S. relations is based on principles,\" the People's Daily said.\nGore is scheduled to arrive in Beijing later on Monday, making him the most senior U.S. official to visit in eight years.\nHis trip is aimed at healing ties that had been badly strained by disputes ranging from human rights to trade and Taiwan.\nIt is also intended to pave the way for an exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin.\n\"The continuation of high level visits, such as the visit of U.S. Vice President Gore and others, is due to the efforts of the two governments and their peoples,\" the newspaper said.\n\"To insist that this is linked to the so-called contributions scandal is ridiculous,\" it said. \"It is a complete fabrication to allege that the improvement in Sino-U.S. relations is due to any improper payments by the Chinese government.\"\nThe People's Daily commentary condemned Taiwan as well as news organisations from the island for the storm of criticism that has engulfed China.\n\"It is widely known that the 'political payments case' stems from Taiwan,\" the newspaper said.\nIt referred to a report last year by a Hong Kong publication, the Chinese language edition of Asiaweek magazine, that said Liu Tai-ying, head of the business management committee of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, had expressed a willingness to contribute $15 million.\nThe People's Daily did not mention that Taiwan has denied the allegations and has sued the magazine.\n\"For some Taiwan politicians it appears that the best way out of their troubles is to put the blame elsewhere,\" said the newspaper.\nTaiwan and China have been rivals since the Nationalists fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the communists in 1949.\nThe United States formally recognises China but maintains trade and other unofficial ties with Taiwan.\nWashington sent warships near Taiwan in a show of support when Beijing staged war games and missile tests to intimidate the island early last year.\n","194":"China's stock regulators are trying to reassert control over what they see as backdoor listings of Chinese companies in Hong Kong, market sources said on Thursday.\nThey said the new concerns were triggered by the listing this week of GITIC Enterprises, a Hong Kong company that is controlled indirectly by the Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp (GITIC), based in the south China city of Guangzhou.\nThey said the problem was particularly sensitive because of the territory's return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1 under a Sino-British accord that promises a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the transfer of political power.\n\"The (Chinese) authorities are certainly worried about this issue and we could see some guidelines emerge before too long,\" said a securities industry executive.\nA foreign securities company executive agreed.\n\"China is worried that a number of good companies will inject mainland assets into Hong Kong companies and then take them public without their approval.\"\nChinese companies that wish to list shares abroad, usually in Hong Kong, need clearance from a number of central government regulatory bodies, including the watchdog agency, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).\nRules for Hong Kong companies controlled by Chinese interests are less clear, but recently many of these firms have first gained approval from Beijing.\nGITIC Enterprises did not get prior clearance and regulatory objections are believed to have presented a last-minute hurdle.\nThe offer was allowed to proceed, however, and was a stunning success. The issue, nearly 900 times subscribed, finished its first day of trading on Wednesday at HK$4.375 compared with its offer price of HK$1.05.\n\"The company is listed now so there is no need to address the issue of whether the CSRC was involved,\" said an official of parent company GITIC, speaking by telephone from Guangzhou.\nAt least two more Hong Kong-registered companies controlled by Chinese firms from Beijing and Tianjin were preparing to offer shares in Hong Kong. They were likely to wait for Chinese regulatory clearance, sources said.\nAnother Guangdong company has postponed plans for an offer of shares by a Hong Kong company it controls because of the latest developments, said sources in Beijing and Hong Kong.\n\"The problem is mainly with Guangdong province,\" said a regulator in Beijing.\nGuangdong, far from the reach of authorities in Beijing and backed by considerable financial muscle, has often been at odds with central government directives.\nThe scope of control over Hong Kong is even more sensitive.\nThe CSRC and other financial regulators have repeatedly said they would not interfere in supervisory matters in Hong Kong, in keeping with Beijing's promises for the territory after the handover.\nAn official at the CSRC was unable to clarify the extent of the agency's regulatory powers on this issue.\n\"I can't comment,\" said the official. \"It is too sensitive.\"\nSecurities regulators in Guangdong underscored the problem of reaching agreement on the issue.\n\"When a company seeks permission from the CSRC we are usually aware of it,\" said a provincial regulatory official.\n\"But a Hong Kong-registered company does not necessarily have to go through the CSRC.\"\n","195":"China's foreign debts reached $109.5 billion at the end of June but the governor of the central bank said the country was confident of paying its bills.\nGovernor of the People's Bank of China Dai Xianglong said the nation's foreign exchange reserves of about $96 billion -- among the biggest in the world -- were comfortable, but not excessive.\n\"We are very prudent in our borrowing,\" he said, adding that the level of debt measured against exports -- or the debt service ratio -- was well within international warning levels.\n\"On the whole the repayment situation is good,\" Dai told Reuters in an interview.\n\"It is hard to say exactly where the debt level will be next year, but every year an additional $10 billion is possible,\" he said.\nHe said $10 billion had been the average annual addition to the debt level over the past five years.\n\"For a country of China's size, (the level of foreign exchange reserves) is not a big sum,\" he said. \"We can only say it is comfortable.\"\nMost of Beijing's debt was long term, but China needed reserves sufficient to maintain repayments as well as to finance four months' worth of imports, he said.\nBeijing also had new needs for foreign currency following the recent move to make the renminbi -- China's currency -- convertible on the current account.\nHe described China's repayment status as good, although he conceded there were repayment problems with enterprises under the direction of local governments.\n\"There are some local government-run enterprises that are overdue,\" he said.\nBut Dai also said foreign banks had a responsibility to ensure that credit went to deserving enterprises.\n\"Foreign creditors of Chinese enterprises must be selective in their lending,\" he said.\nThe central banker said he expected the renminbi to remain stable though he saw upward pressure on the Chinese currency, partly due to an expected trade surplus of more than $10 billion this year.\nThat would be down from the $16.7 billion surplus China recorded last year and much better than initial forecasts for 1996.\nEconomists say faster payments of export tax rebates have encouraged many companies to turn to the export market, thereby helping the trade picture.\nThe renminbi currently trades at about 8.3 to one dollar.\n","196":"China has tightened safety measures after a fatal rocket explosion early this year and has found the cause of another launch failure in August, Chinese space officials said on Wednesday.\nFurther testing was needed for the Long March 3 rocket and that could delay China's launch schedule, they said.\n\"Launch vehicles will now self-destruct if there is a failure,\" said Zhang Qingwei, vice president of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.\n\"We will also ensure that people (living in the area of space centres) will be moved away when we conduct a launch,\" he told an international conference on space technology.\nA Long March 3B rocket exploded shortly after launch in February, killing six people and injuring 57, according to official reports.\nUnofficial sources have put the casualty toll much higher.\nChina's commercial space drive suffered another setback in August when a communications satellite failed to reach proper orbit after launch aboard a Long March 3 rocket.\n\"We have determined the cause of the August 18 failure and have taken corrective measures,\" said Zhang, adding that the problem stemmed from a faulty hydrogen valve on the third stage of the booster rocket.\n\"We are still conducting ground testing,\" he said. \"There will be delays (in the Long March 3) programme this year but this will not affect other Long March vehicles.\"\nAn official of the China Aerospace Corporation, which oversees commercial satellite launches, said a Long March 3 rocket could be launched by the end of the year or early next year.\nTwo other launches using the Long March 2D and Long March 3A rockets were also expected to be made by the end of the year.\nIn January 1995, a Long March rocket blew up, killing six people and destroying the Apstar 2 satellite it was carrying.\nChina once enjoyed a reputation of being a cheap and reliable provider of satellite launch services but the string of failures has shaken its hopes of playing a bigger role in the commercial space business.\n","197":"The Australian stock exchange on Tuesday used the China visit of Prime Minister John Howard to make a high profile sales pitch for Chinese companies to list shares on Australia's stock market.\nThe Australian prime minister, before meeting China's President Jiang Zemin, found time to open a seminar for China's market regulators and top-level managers of its state-run companies designed to show them why they should look to Australia to raise capital.\nSenior officials from the Australian Stock Exchange as well as brokerages and legal firms delivered the message that Australia had much to offer.\n\"Cross-border equities trading now amounts to around $4 trillion a year, which no stock market can afford to ignore,\" Australian Stock Exchange chairman Maurice Newman told the seminar.\n\"I hope that one day we may be able to welcome you to our market.\"\nMost Chinese companies that have listed their shares abroad have chosen Hong Kong where investors have been snapping up China-related stocks.\nOne recent listing of a China-linked company was nearly 900 times oversubscribed, and Australia may find it difficult to generate that kind of interest.\nNewman later told reporters that 19 of 31 Asian-owned companies on the Australian exchange already had a China connection. These companies have often used a corporation not based in China to make the listing, in effect sidestepping regulatory curbs in their home country.\nTrading in some of those issues has not been active.\n\"The liquidity of those companies is mixed,\" said Newman. \"As a group we would prefer that it were greater.\"\nAustralia may soon get its first direct Chinese listing.\nTaihang Cement, a cement producer based in the northern province of Hebei, has already gained approval from Chinese regulatory authorities for a foreign listing.\nCompany officials told reporters they hoped to list their shares in Australia by the year-end.\n\"We chose Australia because we have a foundation there,\" said Zhang Zhixian, Taihang's manager of investment development, noting that the company exports cement to Australia.\nCompany officials said the exact size of the offer had not been set but would range between 100 and 200 million yuan ($12-24 million).\nOther participants at the seminar said Australia might target its efforts at sectors where Australia is already strong, such as in natural resources.\n\"Australia would have a natural advantage in infrastructure and resource-based companies,\" said Tony Greenwood, of law firm Blake Dawson Waldron, noting the heavy weighting of such stocks in Australia.\nOne area of concern for Chinese companies will be financial transparency, which has posed a problem for them in the past.\nSome Chinese companies have had trouble complying with domestic regulations and others have come under criticism in Hong Kong for lack of transparency.\n\"Our concern must also be the integrity of our market,\" said Newman.\n\"It is important that companies are familiar with our listing requirements and they observe them faithfully.\"\n","198":"China's recent string of satellite launch failures may help Russia's commercial space drive, a senior Russian space official said on Wednesday.\nRussia should benefit from its strong space technology, despite lagging behind China in turning technical expertise into commercial success, said Vladimir Oumnikov of the Russian Space Agency.\n\"We have good prospects,\" Oumnikov told Reuters at an international conference on astronautics in Beijing.\nAsked if Chinese setbacks had helped the Russian programme, he said: \"We think so.\"\nAlthough China once had a reputation for providing cheap and reliable launch services, it has been stung by a series of launch failures.\nChina's commercial space drive suffered a setback in August when a communications satellite failed to reach its orbit after launch aboard a Long March 3 rocket.\nLast February, an Intelsat satellite was destroyed in a spectacular explosion as a Long March 3B rocket veered wildly seconds after launch from China's Xichang space centre in the western province of Sichuan.\nAt least six people were killed and 57 injured in the incident, which also destroyed 80 homes near the launch site.\nIn January 1995, a Long March rocket exploded, destroying the Apstar 2 satellite it was carrying.\nLast month, a Russian Proton rocket booster successfully launched a U.S.-built satellite for the international telecommunications organisation Inmarsat and a Proton-K booster rocket launched a satellite for domestic telephone and television use.\n\"We think we have a good system for ensuring reliability,\" said Oumnikov, who is deputy director for economic issues in the Russian Space Agency's division of space projects.\nFailures were common in the space industry and China was not the only supplier of launch services to have such problems, the Russian official said.\nHe added that Russia needed to catch up with China, which has moved ahead with economic reforms that have reduced the reliance on central planning and expanded the role of the marketplace.\n\"We do not have enough experience in commercialisation,\" he said. \"China had a head start in this area.\"\nRussia's parliament was expected to discuss by the end of this year a law that would give a legal basis to the commercial space business, he said.\nThat would remove some of the legal obstacles to Russia's efforts to make a profit from space technology, he added.\n","199":"China published on Saturday a list of anti-dumping rules to protect local companies from unfair foreign competition.\nChinese economists said the rules would help domestic companies, many of them targets of similar dumping claims overseas, protect their share of the domestic market.\nThey also said the move appeared to be aimed at giving a legal framework to protection from unfair competition and clarifying procedures for its use.\n\"Many Chinese companies are unable to compete in the face of unfair trade practices,\" economist Cheng Xiusheng of the State Council (cabinet) development research centre told Reuters.\n\"Many other countries have imposed anti-dumping duties against Chinese products and China needs a system to regulate its own market and protect its companies,\" he said.\nThe rules, published in the official People's Daily, give the government the right to determine whether imported goods are aided by official subsidies and impose anti-dumping duties on foreign goods. Cash guarantees can be demanded to ensure payment.\nPrices in the exporting country or third countries will be used to determine a fair price for goods in dispute and set a countervailing duty.\nThe rules also provide guidelines for domestic companies to file complaints about unfair competition and set a maximum length of 12 months for an investigation. Special cases are allowed to take 18 months. The rules also empower the state to take retaliatory measures against countries that impose \"discriminatory\" countervailing duties against Chinese goods.\nBeijing's official media have said the dumping of foreign goods on the domestic market had cost China some 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) a year and had caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.\nMany domestic manufacturers were pressuring the government to take steps to offset these policies, newspapers have said.\nOther economists said China was trying to codify the protection of its industries and bring its trade policies more in line with international practice.\nThey added that as China sought to join the World Trade Organisation it was being forced to make its polices more transparent.\n","200":"China issued more tough warnings on curbing risk in the financial sector on Thursday, fresh on the heels of the failure of one of its big trust companies.\nIt also accused some officials of ignoring past warnings and covering up problems.\n\"There are all sorts of serious financial crimes now and if these problems are not earnestly addressed, this could greatly weaken the payment system and damage the good reputation of our socialist financial system,\" said the official Financial News in a front-page commentary.\n\"The biggest problem is that some officials look but fail to see the problems in their own regions or departments,\" it said. \"When they see the problems they fail to check on them and in some cases they cover up and encourage such actions.\"\nThe newspaper, published by the central bank, said failure to tackle the problems would exacerbate the nation's deficit and lead to unwanted growth in the money supply.\nThe central bank announced this month the closure of the big China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp (CADTIC), an investment house under the Ministry of Agriculture, because of serious illegal and irregular practices.\nCADTIC's management was taken over by the state-run China Construction Bank while its foreign business was handed over to the Bank of China.\nChina has been trying to separate trust firms from state banks, fearing that trust failures could drag down the banking system and lead to social unrest.\nChina has no bank deposit insurance system and would probably have to step in to support a bank that went into default, banking officials said.\nIts willingness to prop up trust companies is somewhat less certain.\nU.S. rating agency Moody's Investors Service issued a report this month saying that central authorities might not rush to support troubled trusts. Repayment of foreign lenders in the event of future closures was not guaranteed, it said.\nThe Financial News said a planned separation of banks from trust companies -- originally set for completion at the end of last year -- had to be finished in the first half of this year.\nBanking industry officials have said that the huge problems of the China Agribusiness Development Trust, while known to regulators for some time, were a \"wake-up call\" that foreshadowed more problems throughout the financial system.\nThe latest round of warnings followed a national banking conference that focused on excess financial risk in the banking system.\n","201":"China will aim to show U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that improving Sino-American ties will not be harmed by the death of Deng Xiaoping, analysts said on Sunday.\nThey also said Albright, who arrives in China on Monday for a brief stopover on her nine-nation tour, would likely focus on maintaining momentum in the once-stalled ties, looking ahead to exchanges of senior level visits.\n\"China will want to make the point that it is stable after Deng's death,\" said Niu Jun, a specialist in U.S. policy issues at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think-tank.\n\"It will want to demonstrate that there is no change in Sino-U.S. relations,\" he said.\nDeng, architect of sweeping economic reforms that have embraced capitalist-style economic policies, died on Wednesday aged 92.\nAlbright will arrive in Beijing during a six-day mourning period for the nation's paramount leader and one day before the funeral. Chinese leaders have been eager to show that affairs of state will continue as usual.\nDeng's hand-picked successor, President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, has vowed to push ahead with Deng's programme and even outdo him.\nJiang has been in power since he was propelled to the top party post in 1989, when Deng abandoned his old ally Zhao Ziyang in a dispute over the use of force against students pushing for But Jiang now must fend off other contenders for power without the helping hand of his benefactor.\nAlbright, on her first trip overseas since becoming America's top diplomat last month, will meet Jiang as well as Premier Li Peng and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.\nWestern analysts said Albright would not shrink from contentious issues like China's human rights record, but would chart a steady course in the vital Sino-U.S. relationship during President Bill Clinton's second term.\n\"The U.S. wants to ensure that its China relations are no longer scraping along the bottom,\" said a Western diplomat.\nU.S.-China ties had stumbled badly over a range of issues including Taiwan, trade, arms proliferation and human rights.\nA long-delayed visit to Beijing in November by Albright's predecessor Warren Christopher paved the way for the renewed push to put differences aside.\nThat new approach was endorsed at a meeting between Jiang and Clinton at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Manila later that month.\nU.S. Vice President Al Gore will travel to China next month and Clinton and Jiang are expected to exchange visits over the next year.\nAlbright may be compelled to touch on human rights during her talks with Chinese officials as the United States plans to co-sponsor a resolution critical of China at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.\nWashington may also be looking to show at least some measure of toughness towards Beijing to allay domestic concerns following allegations of Chinese contributions to Clinton's re-election campaign.\nBut Albright and other U.S. officials have said no one issue should dominate the relationship.\nAnalysts said that probably means that as for the more difficult problems, the two sides will have to agree to disagree.\n","202":"China vowed on Friday to get tough in its drive to keep banks out of the stock market and accused big financial institutions of fuelling a speculative bubble on the nation's bourses.\nState media quoted China's top economic policy maker, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, as warning bankers that they could go to jail for diverting funds into the stock market.\n\"We will vigorously seek to uncover any use of funds that are not in company accounts or the use of bank credits for stock market speculation,\" Zhu told a national banking conference in Beijing on Thursday.\n\"Those in positions of responsibility will be sacked and in criminal cases we will pursue the offenders under criminal law,\" he said.\nIn a commentary alongside the reports of the meeting, the Financial News, a daily published by the central bank, blamed a big rise in share prices last year on institutional speculation.\n\"Most people believe that a speculative bubble emerged (in the nation's stock markets) at the end of last year,\" it said.\nIt blamed this on a diversion of funds from the banking system into the stock market, and added that it was clear this had involved institutional money.\nBeijing moved to cool off the heated stock market speculation -- which had pushed one of the main indices up as much as 360 percent -- by warning investors that what goes up must come down, and reminding them that the state would not step in to bail them out.\nChina also has been trying to keep its state-run banks from fuelling stock market speculation, first by severing their ties to trust companies -- which can put funds in the stock market -- and by making it harder for them to finance stock speculation.\nSecurities industry officials said the aim was to insulate the banking system from any major setback for the stock market.\n\"This is aimed at protecting the banking system,\" said Wang Yun, general manager of the Shanxi Securities Trading Centre in Taiyuan, a regional trading centre for the main bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\"Central government authorities would also prefer to see these funds go to state enterprises,\" he told the China Securities Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based publication.\nBut brokers said that while ensuring the health of the banking system was a noble goal, authorities should not drive all institutional money away from the market.\n\"China now has more individual investors than it had in the past, but the main investors are institutions,\" said a Beijing-based broker. \"If they are driven away, there won't be much turnover left in the market.\"\n","203":"China has begun a national drive to test all blood products since the discovery of HIV contamination earlier this year, a health official said on Friday.\n\"We have requested all local health authorities to inspect blood products and report the results to us,\" said an official at the Ministry of Public Health.\nThe official, who declined to be named, said the testing followed the discovery in April of some samples of a HIV contaminated product manufactured and sold in the southern province of Guangdong.\nThe product was known as \"Wolongsong\" brand blood albumin, a protein.\nHIV -- Human Immunodeficiency Virus -- is the virus that can lead to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\n\"Following the incident we instituted a national inspection of blood products,\" the official told Reuters.\nAsked how the tainted product had been uncovered, she said: \"I can't tell you that. This is a very sensitive question.\"\nResults of the tests from several provinces had been turned over to central authorities, she said without giving any further details.\nAn official at the Foreign Ministry said public health authorities in Guangdong had called for government agencies around the country to stop the sale and use of the 50- millilitre \"Wolongsong\" albumin.\nGuangdong health officials, contacted by telephone, declined to give any information on the manufacturer or say how much of the product had been on the market when the action was taken.\nThey also declined to say how the item became contaminated, what conditions it was used to treat or how serious the risk was to people who used the product.\nOfficials in Beijing said that an order had been sent to have the Wolongsong product destroyed.\nOfficial figures show China has 4,305 reported HIV cases and the total is expected to reach 5,000 by the end of this year.\nChinese officials quote health experts as saying they believe the actual number is anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000, as many cases go unreported.\nA total of 131 people have been infected with AIDS in China, according to the official media.\nChina has been grappling with growing drug use and prostitution and experts warn these two problems could increase the number of AIDS cases across the country.\n","204":"China may need to adjust the mix of its treasury debt next year to ensure an active response from domestic institutions, analysts said on Friday.\nFinance ministry officials were meeting in Beijing on Friday to discuss bond market trends and the issue of China's debt mix could be a focus of the talks, the analysts said.\n\"There is too much of the non-tradeable type of debt,\" said a Shenzhen analyst. \"It is not really attractive to institutions or individual investors.\"\nChina is issuing about 250 billion yuan ($30.1 billion) of state debt this year -- most of it domestic. More than half of the total is for non-tradeable voucher or certificate type treasury debt.\nIn return for their funds, investors receive a certificate that can be redeemed before maturity. But this type of debt is not listed on either of the nation's stock exchanges in Shanghai or Shenzhen and no active secondary trading exists.\nLast year, this non-tradeable type of debt accounted for only about one-tenth of total government debt issued, bond traders said.\n\"Last year the focus was on the secondary market,\" said a trader with J&amp;A Securities in Shenzhen. \"Most of the debt was tradeable on the nation's exchanges.\"\nOther securities firms agreed the response so far this year had been less than enthusiastic.\n\"There is not that much interest in the (non-tradeable) offer this year,\" said an official at China Southern Securities. \"I am not very optimistic about the outcome.\"\nA Finance Ministry official denied there were problems with the sales, which began on March 1.\n\"I am satisfied with the outcome so far,\" the official told Reuters. \"We have until October to complete the sales.\"\nThe bonds are offered through bank underwriting syndicates, and analysts said that if the banks have to keep too much of the debt on their own books, they are unlikely to be enthusiastic about next year's issue.\nThe trend was particularly marked in southern China where economic development has outpaced the rest of the country, giving investors more types of investment vehicles to choose from.\nAn official at the state-run Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Shenzhen branch described the response to the offer in the special economic zone bordering Hong Kong as poor.\nSome analysts said the problem lay elsewhere. \"The interest rate is the real problem,\" said Zhao Xiaoyun, an analyst at China Securities Co.\nZhao said bond interest rates were unable to match the returns available on the stock market. Domestic A shares in Shanghai have gained 40 percent since the start of the year.\nThe 1997 state offer includes two-, three- and five-year debt carrying interest of 8.64 percent, 9.18 percent and 10.17 percent. This is 0.72, 0.92 and 1.17 percentage points higher than the interest paid on bank time deposits of corresponding periods.\nIn the recent past, interest on bonds has been 1.5 to two percentage points higher than equivalent bank rates. But analysts said China may not want to widen the spread between time deposits and bonds too much. The banks may underwrite the debt but they are not eager to see their deposits drawn away by higher interest bonds.\nThat could mean the best option for the state is to issue debt that can be traded and attracts institutional investors.\n","205":"China said on Thursday it strongly opposed a visit to Jordan by Taiwan's foreign minister and accused its island rival of trying to disrupt Beijing's ties with other friendly states.\nIt also accused Taipei's leaders of lacking sincerity towards improving relations with Beijing.\n\"We deeply regret and express our strong dissatisfaction with Jordan and other states for allowing a visit by (Taiwan Foreign Minister) John Chang,\" said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang.\n\"We are resolutely opposed to the development of government links or any other form of official contacts with Taiwan by any states that have diplomatic ties with our country,\" he told a news briefing.\nTaiwan's foreign minister arrived in Jordan on Wednesday in a visit shrouded in secrecy.\nJordan has diplomatic relations with China but has strong commercial ties with Taiwan.\nChang gave an economics lecture at a northern Jordanian university, sources at the university said. Jordanian government officials declined to comment on the visit.\nChina has viewed Taiwan as a rebel province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and has not ruled out the use of force to recover the island.\nIt has tried to isolate Taiwan by insisting the island was not entitled to formal relations with foreign states.\nTaiwanese media said Chang, who left Taiwan earlier this week, was travelling to Abu Dhabi and Jordan, en route to Italy.\nThe trip is one of four overseas damage-control missions planned by top Taiwan officials since South Africa, Taipei's largest ally, declared last month it would switch ties to Beijing by the end of next year.\n\"Taiwan authorities are trying to disrupt our friendly relations with other states,\" Shen said, repeating Beijing's frequent accusation that Taiwan was trying to create \"two Chinas\".\n\"Taiwan's leaders...lacked sincerity towards improving relations between the two sides,\" Shen said.\nTaiwan's leaders had taken a negative attitude towards improving economic and trade ties with the mainland and this would not help improve relations, he said.\n","206":"China on Tuesday announced a ban on poultry and poultry products from two U.S. states hit by an outbreak of a deadly disease.\nThe ban is already in effect and covers poultry from the states of Missouri and Oklahoma, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture told Reuters by telephone.\nIt was aimed at preventing damage from a \"very destructive disease\", the ministry official said.\nThe official said, however, that China had banned all U.S. poultry brought into the country either by mail or hand-carried by travellers.\n\"Travellers are barred from bringing in any poultry goods from the United States,\" he said. \"These products also cannot be brought into China through the mail.\"\nAn official of the State Bureau of Animal Plant and Quarantine said the ban went into effect on Monday.\nOfficial news reports said the ban was slapped on poultry products from the two states because of five cases of a deadly poultry flu discovered between July and September.\nThe quarantine official told Reuters that the action was unrelated to other trade disputes with the United States and there was no plan to delay implementation of the decision.\nThe virus in question, known as viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease, or VVND, is deadly, Phillip Holloway, representative in Hong Kong and China for the Oklahoma state agriculture department, told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\"It's a very, very dangerous disease -- the most feared of poultry diseases,\" he said. \"The symptoms are like influenza, and once one bird gets the disease, all the poultry will die.\"\nBut Holloway said he had not heard of any recent cases of VVND in Oklahoma.\nThe last major outbreak of VVND in the United States occurred in California in the 1970s and led to the eradication of the state's entire poultry population, he said.\nBeijing and Washington are also at odds over textile imports, and that dispute has threatened to spill over into the farm sector.\nChina had threatened to ban some U.S. farm goods -- as well as textiles and alcoholic drinks -- in retaliation for U.S. penalties on textiles purchased from China.\nOn Sunday, Beijing announced it was delaying for one month implementation of those restrictions, which had been scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, because the two sides were planning to hold further talks on the issue.\nIn October, China announced a ban on imports of poultry from 10 U.S. states because of fears the meat carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).\nChina and the United States held talks averting the ban, worth nearly $500 million a year.\nChina is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products.\nU.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled 330,000 tonnes transshipped through Hong Kong and were worth $445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.\nEvery day 700 tonnes of U.S. chicken feet are transported across the border from Hong Kong into China, according to the council.\n","207":"China International Trust and Investment Corp, one of China's major conglomerates, is focusing its domestic operations on the financial sector where it hopes to see 70 percent of its profits, a top executive said.\n\"We are making money in the financial sector though manufacturing is having a hard time now,\" said Chang Zhenming, group executive director.\n\"We see finance contributing about 70 percent of our domestic net profit in the near term,\" he said in a recent interview.\nChang chose his words carefully, saying that the finance business would be used \"to serve the conglomerate's commercial and industrial operations\".\nBut company officials said that CITIC had been disappointed, with some of its early industrial investments -- such as in the machinery and garment sectors -- and it would like to remould itself as a financial services company.\nCITIC reported profit of 2.05 billion yuan ($247 million) last year, up from 1.67 billion yuan in 1994.\nMost of CITIC's income is from its huge Hong Kong arm, which includes listed CITIC Pacific Ltd.\nBut for the group's domestic operations, CITIC Industrial Bank is the main contributor, accounting for net profits of about 1.0 billion yuan last year, up 20 percent over 1994.\nProfits from the bank were likely to climb another 20 percent this year, despite the impact on interest income from two cuts in interest rates this year, Chang said.\n\"We have a good base of corporate clients,\" said Chang.\nHe added that this gave the bank a reliable source of low-cost call-money deposits from major companies.\nChang said the bank had also been able to hold the line on bad debts -- a key problem for many of China's banks -- though no figure was given.\n\"We are a bit more conservative than some of the other banks so we've had fewer bad loans,\" he said.\nThe group expected to earn more than 100 million yuan this year from its securities operations, though commodities trading would be break-even at best, the executive said.\nCITIC still has diversified domestic interests ranging from power projects and telecommunications to automotive production and real estate.\nFinance probably acounts for more than 70 percent of domestic profits at the moment, largely because of poor results from several industrial investments while other more promising projects are still in their early stages.\nBut Chang said reforms that had created so-called joint stock companies probably would spur the company's development in the financial sector, as more companies would seek loans on commercial terms rather than rely on state funding.\nChang also said the company wanted to expand its financial operations to include property insurance. It was seeking to form a joint venture with other domestic partners though this project still required regulatory approval.\n","208":"China has scored new successes in its fight against inflation and economists said on Friday that price rises this year could be well below target.\nSome economists say inflation has been squeezed out of the economy with only a modest impact on growth as economic expansion continued at a fairly rapid pace.\n\"This is better than expected,\" said Chen Dezun, head of the price research institute of the State Planning Commission.\n\"We could see inflation of between three and four percent this year,\" he told Reuters. The benchmark retail price index rose a meagre 1.7 percent in March and 2.6 percent for the first quarter of the year, the State Statistical Bureau said on Thursday.\nChina forecast a 6.0 percent rise in retail prices this year after a 6.1 percent increase last year. That was already well below the 14.8 percent recorded in 1995 and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.\nChina's economic growth is expected to top 10 percent this year after a solid 9.7 percent in 1996.\nThe inflation figure for the first quarter was also below an estimate by Premier Li Peng this week that retail price inflation would average 3.0 percent in the January-March period.\nChen said good weather had been a factor, ensuring steady supplies of agricultural goods and keeping prices down.\nWhat China officially refers to as \"appropriately tight\" monetary policies had also been a crucial factor, he said.\n\"The appropriately tight monetary policies are now showing results,\" he said.\nChina has kept controls on fixed asset investment, keeping government spending down, and that has kept a cap on the demand for goods such as construction materials.\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the real rise in fixed asset investment last year was a fairly modest 11.5 percent.\n\"The key has been control over fixed asset investment,\" said Zhong Jiyun, an economist at the state think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\nSome economists have argued that with the battle against inflation proceeding favourably, China can now afford to ease its monetary policies.\nMany inefficient state-run enterprises are swimming in red ink and saddled with debt they cannot repay.\nManagers of these companies and their local government officials have called for easier credit to help to reduce their heavy financial burden.\nBut Zhong is among the economists who believe that China is not yet able to declare the war on inflation over.\n\"I believe we still need to keep the controls on,\" he said.\n","209":"China gave U.S. President Bill Clinton a signal on Sunday that the election had not cleared away nagging trade disputes, saying it planned tit-for-tat curbs on American imports.\nBeijing said it would suspend temporarily its imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks in retaliation for Washington's imposition of punitive charges on American purchases of Chinese textiles.\nThe announcement came only days after Clinton's re-election triumph and ahead of a planned visit to Beijing this month by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.\nSino-U.S. relations have been strained over the last year by a range of issues from Taiwan to arms proliferation to trade and human rights.\nChina and the U.S. have said they saw an improvement in relations since the two sides narrowly averted a trade war over copyright piracy and exchanged diplomatic fire over Beijing's political rival, Taiwan, earlier this year.\nBeijing said last week that it saw Clinton's re-election as a good opportunity for better ties in a \"somewhat improved atmosphere\".\nThe temporary import ban, which would take effect on December 10, was in retaliation for what China called severe violations by the U.S. of a bilateral textile accord.\n\"The decision was made in response to the U.S. unilateral cut of import quotas of Chinese textiles, which severely violated the bilateral textile agreement,\" the official Xinhua news agency said.\nIn September, Washington announced punitive charges against 1996 import quotas for Chinese textile goods, accusing China of using transshipments to avoid U.S. quota restrictions.\nThe action -- which was expected to cost China about $19 million -- marked the first time Washington had imposed so-called triple charges against repeated violations of a bilateral textile accord.\nThe U.S. move was made without full consultation and clear supporting evidence, Xinhua said.\nBeijing accused Washington of imposing a series of barriers that had seriously affected Chinese textile export to the U.S. as well as China's ability to pay for American imports.\nChina said it had urged the U.S. to withdraw the penalties but its pleas had been ignored, leaving it no choice but to take action.\nChina's import suspension would also apply to U.S. fruits and animal husbandry products, though there was no indication of which specific items would be barred within the broad product categories.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the General Administration of Customs would have a detailed list ready before December 10, according to Xinhua.\nChina also said it opposed any attempt to impose the will of one side upon others in trade matters, and called on the U.S. to avoid such measures in future.\n\"Once again, we wish to urge the United States to handle trade disputes in the spirit of advancing bilateral trade, and refrain from taking any actions harmful to bilateral trade in the future,\" it said.\n","210":"China said on Monday it expected talks with the United States soon on a dispute over U.S. sanctions on its textiles and its own threat to retaliate.\nBeijing also said it was still too soon to say which U.S. imports would be banned if Washington failed to withdraw penalties on imported Chinese textiles.\n\"We expect to see working level talks with the U.S. in the near future,\" an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation told Reuters.\n\"The two sides will exchange views,\" he said.\nBeijing said on Sunday it would suspend temporarily its imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods, animal husbandry products, fruits and alcoholic drinks in retaliation for Washington's imposition of punitive charges on American purchases of Chinese textiles.\nThe temporary import ban would take effect on December 10.\nIn September, Washington announced punitive charges against import quotas for Chinese textile goods, accusing China of using transshipments to avoid U.S. quota restrictions.\nChina said the action was taken without consultation and with no clear supporting evidence, adding it had no choice but to impose retaliatory sanctions.\n\"We are still seeking the views of Chinese enteprises about which products should be included under the ban,\" the Chinese official said.\n\"That will be determined in another 30 days.\"\nThe total of trade affected by Washington's action was estimated at $19 million -- only a fraction of Sino-U.S. trade, which is now heavily in China's favour. The United States says its trade deficit with China last year was more than $35 billion.\nBut China's threatened trade ban, made ahead of a planned visit to Beijing this month by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, meant yet another face-off in the frequently testy Sino-U.S. ties.\nRelations have been strained over the last year by a range of issues from Taiwan to arms proliferation to trade and human rights.\nChina and the United States have said they saw an improvement in relations since they narrowly averted a trade war over copyright piracy and exchanged diplomatic fire over Beijing's political rival Taiwan earlier this year.\nThe two sides are preparing for high level exchanges next year, including a possible visit to China by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and a summit between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton.\nChristopher's visit was expected to pave the way for these meetings.\n","211":"The choice of Singapore for the listing of China's big oil and chemicals trader was at least partly a political decision, Chinese officials and foreign securities analysts said.\nThey said that close ties between China and Singapore helped in the choice of the island state for the proposed offer of Sinochem's shares.\n\"The decision to list in Singapore was partly due to good relations between China and Singapore,\" said Fu Yong, chairman of Sinochem Asia Holdings, the Sinochem arm which could be listed in Singapore.\n\"Singapore is also a stable and prosperous environment,\" he told securities analysts and reporters invited to the company's headquarters.\nSo far, Hong Kong has attracted the bulk of the foreign listings of Chinese companies.\nSinochem, whose full name is China National Chemicals Import and Export Corp, is a major state trading company that has used some of the cash from its lucrative trading operations to expand into numerous new businesses.\nUnder the proposed stock offer, currently under review by the Singapore bourse, Sinochem would place only some of its Asian trading operations -- including those in Singapore -- into the listed company.\nIt has not said how many shares would be offered or how much money might be raised.\nSecurities analysts said they were unsure how much profit could be expected from the operations in the listed company. But they added that the parent firm clearly had the financial clout to list assets on any of a number of foreign stock exchanges.\nSinochem's trading turnover swelled to $18.21 billion last year from $14.98 billion in 1994.\nCompany officials said the firm controls 40 percent of all of China's crude oil imports and has a 50 percent share of the company that accounts for the remainder.\nIt owns a share of a big joint venture oil refinery in the northeast city of Dalian, has a newly formed insurance joint venture with Manufacturers Life of Canada and has taken a stake in China's fledgling second telephone network.\nIt is now a major real estate holder, having splashed out with 700 million yuan ($84 million) to build its Beijing headquarters, and it is part owner of an 88-storey commercial tower being built in Shanghai.\nCompany officials hinted strongly that further stock offerings were to be expected -- most likely in Hong Kong -- if the Singapore listing went smoothly.\nSingapore has become a model of sorts for China's vision of the future, according to Western diplomats.\nIt has raised living standards through rapid economic development while keeping tight political controls, they said.\nSingapore has carefully cultivated political and economic ties with China since diplomatic links were forged in 1990. It has pushed hard to make a success of its flagship project in China -- a big industrial park in the eastern city of Suzhou.\nIf Sinochem's listing proposal obtains final approval, it would not be the only such Chinese state company to offer shares in Singapore as several China-linked firms have already listed.\nFellow Chinese company Guangzhou Investment -- the Hong Kong-listed investment arm of the southern city of Guangzhou -- is also looking to Singapore.\nSinochem said that Singapore's key role in the Asian oil refining and trading business was also a factor in its choice as the place of listing.\nSecurities analysts said that Sinochem probably would get a better price for the shares in Singapore than in Hong Kong.\nBut the analysts noted that strong political ties helped gain support from Beijing.\n\"In this case, politics clearly played a role,\" said a Singapore-based analyst.\n","212":"China published on Saturday a list of anti-dumping rules to protect local companies from unfair foreign competition.\nChinese economists said the rules would help domestic companies, many of them targets of similar dumping claims overseas, protect their share of the domestic market.\nThey also said the move appeared to be aimed at giving a legal framework to protection from unfair competition and clarifying procedures for its use.\n\"Many Chinese companies are unable to compete in the face of unfair trade practices,\" economist Cheng Xiusheng of the State Council (cabinet) development research centre told Reuters.\n\"Many other countries have imposed anti-dumping duties against Chinese products and China needs a system to regulate its own market and protect its companies,\" he said.\nThe rules, published in the official People's Daily, give the government the right to determine whether imported goods are aided by official subsidies and impose anti-dumping duties on foreign goods. Cash guarantees can be demanded to ensure payment.\nPrices in the exporting country or third countries will be used to determine a fair price for goods in dispute and set a countervailing duty.\nThe rules also provide guidelines for domestic companies to file complaints about unfair competition and set a maximum length of 12 months for an investigation. Special cases are allowed to take 18 months.\nThe rules also empower the state to take retaliatory measures against countries that impose \"discriminatory\" countervailing duties against Chinese goods.\nBeijing's official media have said the dumping of foreign goods on the domestic market had cost China some 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) a year and had caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.\nMany domestic manufacturers were pressuring the government to take steps to offset these policies, newspapers have said.\nOther economists said China was trying to codify the protection of its industries and bring its trade policies more in line with international practice.\nThey added that as China sought to join the World Trade Organisation it was being forced to make its polices more transparent.\n","213":"Asia gave a cautious welcome on Friday to U.S. President Bill Clinton's appointments for the key posts of secretaries of state and defence, mixing public praise with some private misgivings.\nU.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, tapped to become the first woman secretary of state, and Senator William Cohen, who would take up the defence post, were seen as able appointees, though both were perceived as short on Asian expertise.\nAnalysts said Asian nations that had been targets of U.S. pressure on human rights might also have cause for new concerns, particularly with the outspoken Albright in the top foreign policy job.\nClinton named his United Nations envoy and the Republican senator from Maine on Thursday as his choices for the Cabinet posts to succeed Warren Christopher and William Perry. Senate confirmation for both nominees was widely expected.\nJapanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he did not foresee any impact on U.S.-Japan relations.\n\"I do not expect any changes in U.S.-Japan ties and I hope we can work together to deepen our relations,\" he told reporters.\nBut government sources said both appointees were unfamilar with Japan and their counterparts in Tokyo would soon begin the task of getting acquainted with them.\nChina, which has seen an easing of its strains with the United States of late, said it welcomed Albright's appointment and looked forward to a continuation of improving ties.\n\"We congratulate Ms Albright on her nomination as secretary of state,\" a foreign ministry spokesman said.\n\"We hope that while she is secretary of state, China and the United States ... will grasp the opportunities and make mutual efforts to improve and develop Sino-U.S. ties.\"\nSino-U.S. relations had been buffeted over the past two years by disputes over Taiwan, arms proliferation, trade and human rights. Relations have improved markedly in recent months, most notably with a meeting between Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin in the Philippines last month.\nBut Chinese specialists in U.S. policy issues said a lack of experience in Asian affairs would prove a handicap for the two new Cabinet members, though they expected this to be overcome.\nThey said that human rights issues, still a source of friction, had been put aside for the time being, and were unlikely to upset bilateral ties.\nBurma could be one Asian state to have misgivings about the new post for Albright, particularly in the sphere of human rights, analysts said.\nThere was no official comment from the Burmese government but a Western diplomat in Rangoon said Albright's appointment would be viewed negatively as her past statements on human rights and women's issues have not been welcome.\nThe United States has also been critical on occasion of Indonesia's human rights record though Jakarta's reaction to Albright's appointment was upbeat. Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas described her as an able and experienced diplomat.\nSouth Korea saw the new U.S. Cabinet appointees as likely to maintain pressure on rival North Korea as both are wary of the potential threat posed by Pyongyang.\n\"The U.S. policy of trying to guide North Korea to a soft landing and keeping the freeze on Pyongyang's nuclear programme will continue,\" a government official said.\n\"The new team is also likely to promote dialogue between South and North Korea,\" he added.\nNorth Korea invaded the South in 1950 and the two sides remain technically at war. Hostilities ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty.\nAlbright won an enthusiastic response from some quarters, such as in the Philippines where she was called an inspiration to women worldwide.\n\"I am glad that the United States showed the way,\" said Katrina Legarda, one of the country's prominent women lawyers.\n\"This development is so rare,\" she said.\n","214":"The United States and China may not be on the verge of a breakthrough in often testy ties, but both sides can claim gains from visits by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, analysts said on Monday.\nThe key objective for the two sides was to ensure they moved closer to the goal of an exchange of presidential visits, putting the final seal on efforts to repair damaged relations.\n\"Gore's visit took them one step closer to that goal,\" said a foreign diplomat in Beijing.\nGore reassured the Chinese that Washington remained committed to an exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and China's President Jiang Zemin, telling reporters that officials from both countries were working on specific dates.\nThe United States and China have been moving painstakingly to ease strains over disputes ranging from Taiwan to trade and human rights.\nGore, the most senior U.S. official in Beijing since the 1989 crackdown on student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, said his talks with Chinese leaders last week touched on the key areas of disagreement but he described China's reaction as milder than in the past.\nWhile the speaker of the House of Representatives had somewhat tougher talk in public for his Chinese hosts, pointedly referring to Beijing's policies on human rights and Taiwan, the content was not unexpected.\n\"He is a bit less constrained in what he can say,\" said a Chinese journalist who covers foreign affairs. \"China recognises this.\"\nMore importantly for China's leaders, the visit by the key Republican and other members of a bipartisan congressional delegation presented an opportunity for Beijing to make a personal pitch on major issues such as Taiwan.\nJiang used his meeting with Gingrich on Friday to note how pleased he was that more congressmen were visiting China to see first hand the importance of the Taiwan issue to Beijing.\nChina and Taiwan, rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, are vying for the sympathies of American policymakers and the public.\nThe United States recognises China but has strong commercial and other unofficial ties with the island that Beijing views as a renegade province.\nBeijing believes it was misled by Washington over the landmark 1995 visit to the U.S. by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui. The administration assured Beijing that no visit would be permitted but the trip was allowed to proceed under pressure from Congress.\nBoth Washington and Beijing struggled to ensure that accusations of illegal Chinese funding for the Democratic Party did not overshadow the Gore visit.\nGore reassured Beijing that unless there was firm evidence of illegal payments, the issue would not affect U.S. policy.\nThe visit also underscored Washington's hopes that no one issue be allowed to dominate the Sino-U.S. relationship.\n\"Trade issues as well as human rights will all remain on the table for discussion in the future,\" said another diplomat. If there was any one area where specific progress could be expected soon, perhaps it was trade, another diplomat said.\nAmerican figures put the U.S. trade deficit with China at about $40 billion last year, and Washington has been pushing for greater access to the China market to narrow the gap.\nChinese officials have conceded they are concerned over the trade issue.\nDuring the Gore visit, U.S. aircraft maker Boeing nailed down a $685 million jet sale and General Motors gained clearance for a long-stalled car venture.\n\"We may see more such big contracts in the coming months,\" said a diplomat. \"But a $40 billion (U.S.) trade deficit is not going to go away overnight.\"\n","215":"China gave new details on Wednesday of the failed launch of a satellite aboard its Long March 3B rocket in February, confirming that the cause lay with the new generation launcher.\nThe report concluded that the failure of the Long March 3B was due to an electrical problem in the power module of the \"inertial platform\" that operated the rocket's direction controls.\n\"There was no electric current output from the power module in the servo-loop on the follow-up frame of the inertia platform,\" a spokesman for the China Great Wall Industrial Corp, which handles China's launches, quoted the report as saying.\n\"All other systems operated normally,\" the report said.\nThe initial report had said briefly that the problem was a failure of the rocket's inertial platform.\nThe Long March 3B, which was being used in a launch for the first time, veered wildly seconds after lift-off from the Xichang satellite centre in southwestern Sichuan province.\nIt ended its flight in a spectacular explosion that destroyed the rocket and the U.S.-made Intelsat satellite it was carrying.\nThe latest report said the rocket smashed into a hillside 1.85 km (1.2 miles) from the launch site.\nOfficial reports said six people were killed and 57 injured, although a video smuggled out by an Israeli scientist showed extensive damage to buildings in the area, suggesting that the number of casualties might have been considerably higher.\nThe final report said that because of the severity of the explosion, no large pieces of wreckage of the satellite or the rocket remained.\nThe report's conclusions were drawn largely from film of the launch and data from remote testing.\nChina's space programme once had a reputation for dependability, but has been marred by a string of recent failures.\nIt suffered a blow to its hopes to capture a significant share of the commercial satellite launch market when a Long March 3 rocket failed to lift a U.S.-built satellite into proper orbit last month.\nThe preliminary conclusion blamed the failure on a problem with the third-stage booster of the Long March 3 rocket, which is supposed to be one of China's most reliable launch vehicles.\nChina has come under pressure from potential foreign customers as well as the insurance industry to disclose more information on the problems with its launches so far.\nIn January 1995, a Long March rocket blew up, destroying the Apstar 2 satellite and killing six people on the ground.\nHowever, China successfully launched Hong Kong's Apstar 1A telecommunications satellite in July after delaying the launch following last February's Long March 3B explosion.\n","216":"China has made a gesture to the United States by ordering Boeing jets but it has left the door open to the aircraft maker's European rival in a thinly veiled mix of politics and commerce, analysts said on Tuesday.\nThey said improving Sino-U.S. ties, highlighted by the visit of U.S. Vice President Al Gore, had enabled Boeing Co to sign a pact to sell five 777s to Air China for $685 million.\nBut Beijing was holding back orders for planes it clearly needed, keeping a close eye on the progress of Sino-U.S. ties and squeezing maximum concessions from Washington on a range of trade issues, they said.\n\"This is a very political game,\" said a foreign diplomat.\n\"The Chinese are moving ahead cautiously. The decisions are made by (Premier) Li Peng himself.\"\nDiplomats said new deals for Boeing or rival Airbus Industrie could be linked to China's campaign to join the World Trade Organisation.\nThe United States has been the most vocal advocate of wresting further concessions from China in liberalising its domestic market before it is allowed to join the trade body.\nBeijing may also be hoping to make progress in its bid to persuade Washington to grant it permanent most favoured nation trading status to avoid an annual review.\nBoeing officials said they had been looking to sell 10 of their twin-engine 777s to Air China, the main Chinese international carrier.\nThey insisted the smaller-than-hoped-for order, delayed by more than one year by Sino-U.S. friction, was a commercial decision and they were confident of making more sales for the same type of plane in future.\nChina often assails the West for mixing trade and diplomacy.\nBut the political drama behind the Boeing deal was highlighted by the signing ceremony in the Great Hall of the People as both Gore and Premier Li looked on.\nGore is the most senior U.S. official to visit China since then-president George Bush travelled to Beijing in early 1989 -- just months before a crackdown on democracy protests in the Chinese capital's Tiananmen Square.\n\"Airbus will be disappointed at today's order,\" said a another Western diplomat.\n\"They were looking to sell the A330-300,\" a twin-engine jet that Airbus says it has not yet sold in China.\nBut Boeing has hardly dealt its key rival a knockout blow.\n\"This is not a mega-order,\" said an industry analyst.\nThe next sign of how political ties translate into contracts could emerge at the forthcoming visit by French President Jacques Chirac.\nAnalysts said they would watch closely to see whether new plane orders go to Airbus Industrie and how many planes were purchased.\nChina has said it will put in service some 240 more planes during the current five-year plan ending in the year 2000 to keep up with rising demand for domestic and international air travel. Most of those planes have yet to be ordered.\nBoeing officials, quoting Chinese data, said they were well ahead in the China market so far with some 216 planes in service against 29 for Airbus.\nBut Boeing underwent a dry spell in 1996, notching only a handful of sales in a year in which Sino-U.S. ties were rocked by Beijing's sabre-rattling aimed at Taiwan as well as disputes over trade, arms control and human rights.\nAirbus signed a pact for 30 of the Airbus A320 narrow body jets in April last year in a deal worth $1.5 billion.\nThose planes compete with Boeing's smaller 737 jets.\nBoeing officials said that with some of the political friction out of the way, they expect more market inroads, and note the latest deal brings this year's sales to $1.2 billion.\nBut analysts cautioned that despite the improvement in Sino-U.S. ties, issues between the two states were unlikely to be resolved soon and would add a political tint to future commercial deals.\n","217":"A top Chinese official for contacts with Taiwan ruled out an early resumption of talks on reunification because the island's leaders were pursuing \"splittist\" policies, the China Daily said on Tuesday.\nIt also quoted Tang Shubei, vice-chairman of the Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), as saying that Taiwanese authorities did not want the handover of Hong Kong to go smoothly and might try to disrupt the transfer of power.\n\"In the long term the mainland and Taiwan should sit down at the negotiating table to discuss cross-straits issues under the 'one-China' policy,\" Tang was quoted as saying.\nBut he said the atmosphere for talks would not improve in the short term unless Taiwan's leaders, including its \"so-called\" President Lee Teng-hui, halted their \"splittist\" activities aimed at independence for the island.\nChina and Taiwan have been rivals since the Nationalist government fled to the island after its defeat by the communists in the Chinese civil war in 1949.\nBeijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and tries to isolate it diplomatically.\nTalks between the two sides were broken off after President Lee made a landmark private visit to the United States in mid-1995, enraging Beijing.\n\"We have the patience to handle the issue of the peaceful reunification of the motherland,\" Tang said.\nThe newspaper also said Taiwan authorities would likely take measures to reduce the impact on the island from the success of China's policies towards Hong Kong, which reverts to Beijing sovereignty on July 1 after 150 years of British rule.\n\"According to Tang, there is information that Taiwan forces in Hong Kong are planning to cause trouble, such as demonstrations around July 1, when China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over the territory,\" the newspaper said.\nTang also repeated Beijing's long-held stance that the United States should halt arms sales to Taiwan.\nThe Chinese official's remarks were published by the English language newspaper as the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, was visiting Taiwan.\nBeijing insists the 1989 winner of the Nobel Peace prize is waging a campaign for independence for Tibet.\nTang made no mention of Beijing's announcement last week that it would return a Taiwanese man suspected of hijacking a Taiwan passenger jet to mainland China.\nBeijing wants Taiwan to return Chinese hijackers now in Taiwanese jails but so far it has been disappointed.\n","218":"China called on Japan on Thursday to stop encouraging right-wing activities on disputed South China Sea islands or risk an escalation of the diplomatic row.\nHowever, it stopped short of spelling out what action it would take over the islands -- claimed by Beijing, Tokyo and Taipei -- adding that it would exercise restraint.\n\"Japan should recognise the seriousness of the matter and take actions to stop these...illegal activities,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a regular news briefing.\n\"If Japan continues to encourage them the situation will be even more serious,\" he said of the right-wing activists. \"The ball is in Japan's court.\"\nA long-dormant dispute over the islands, called the Diaoyus in Chinese and the Senkakus by Japan, erupted in July after the right-wing Japan Youth Federation erected a lighthouse on one of the islets.\nFriction mounted earlier this month after Japanese coast-guard ships barred private Taiwan boats from reaching the area while the rightist group repaired the typhoon-damaged structure.\nBeijing and Taipei have assailed Japan's protection of the rightists' activities and ordered Tokyo to keep people away from the islands that lie east of China's southeastern Fujian coast, west of Japan's Okinawa island and northeast of Taiwan.\nChinese in the British colony of Hong Kong have also closed ranks, ignoring other political disputes and voicing support for Beijing's claim to the islands.\nOn Tuesday, Beijing lodged a strong protest with Tokyo and called in the charge d'affaires in Beijing, warning of serious damage to ties if Japan failed to stop right-wingers from setting foot on the islands.\nAsked by reporters whether Beijing would consider stronger measures, Shen said: \"We hope this issue will be handled with restraint.\"\nJapan on Thursday urged China, Taiwan and Hong Kong to deal calmly with the territorial dispute.\nA group of more than 100 Chinese nationalists on Wednesday urged China's top military brass to send warships to the disputed Diaoyu islands to tear down structures built by Japanese rightists.\nThe response of China's military commission, which is headed by Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin, was not immediately available.\nHong Kong activists, members of the pro-democracy Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, were in Beijing to present to Chinese authorities a petition signed by 17,000 people urging the government to get tough on Japan's claim to the islands.\nIn Taiwan on Thursday, fishermen hurled rotten fish at Japan's Taipei visa office in protest over Tokyo's actions in the dispute.\n","219":"In China's headlong rush to develop, first in its fanatical leftwing past and then in the get-rich-quick days of reform, it has hacked or bulldozed away much of its architectural heritage.\nGraceful old courtyards of Beijing have fallen victim to the development onslaught in recent years, crumbling alongside one of the earliest casualties -- the once majestic Beijing city wall.\nBuilt to ward off invaders centuries ago, the wall was unable to withstand the inroads of its own people bent on discarding what was considered out of date.\nBut China's capital is trying to make amends for some of its past excesses by restoring a small portion of the wall that encircled the city until it was dismantled in the years after the communist takeover in 1949.\nResidents of Beijing have been answering a public call to return city wall bricks to help rebuild a small section of the structure.\nBricks once buried in courtyards, kept as household ornaments or used as building materials have been handed over to a group restoring the wall under the direction of the Beijing city government.\n\"We hope to have about 115 metres of the wall restored this year,\" said Li Yancheng of the Beijing Historical Relics Construction Co of the municipal government.\nMING DYNASTY KILNS\nSome 30,000 bricks from the old wall have been donated to the project and now sit stacked on a city lot where they will be used in the restoration effort.\nWorkers chip off hardened soil, revealing the names of Ming dynasty kilns (1368-1644 A.D.) where the bricks were fired.\n\"As a child I remember helping take down part of the wall,\" said Li. \"Adults were doing it so I joined in. Now I have a chance to put some of the wall back together.\"\nThe wall, which stood 12 metres (39 ft) tall and 16 metres wide (52 ft) in some places, was built largely in the Ming dynasty, although some parts dated back to the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368 A.D.), a period of Mongol rule.\nCITY WALL CLEARED TO MAKE ROOM FOR TIANANMEN SQUARE\nLarge chunks of the wall were pulled down in the 1950s when Beijing's communist leaders created Tiananmen Square.\nMore was torn down in the 1960s and 1970s for the construction of one of the city's main roads and for the subway.\nMany of the city gates were left standing, although what had been the Zhonghua Gate is now the site of the mausoleum for late revolutionary leader Mao Zedong in the centre of Tiananmen Square.\nIn more recent years, market-style economic reforms have sent real estate values soaring, leading to the wholesale clearing of older buildings to make way for sleak new office towers.\nOne such real estate project has led to the demolition of homes that had been built up against the wall. The outline of those homes is still visible on the section being restored.\nThe redevelopment has also revealed a bomb shelter, built nearby during tension with the former Soviet Union in the 1960s and using city wall bricks.\nRETIRED SHOEMAKER ANSWERS STATE'S CALL FOR HELP\nHai Changhai, a 71-year-old retired shoemaker, is one of the Beijing residents who answered the state's call to bring back bricks taken home when the wall was demolished.\n\"They were in our yard and weren't doing anyone much good,\" he said after pedalling his tricycle across town to make a donation. \"Now the state can make use of them.\"\nSome Beijing residents point an accusing finger at the state -- and the ruling Communist Party -- for all the destruction of the past.\n\"None of the communist leaders wanted to protect these things,\" said Dai Qing, a dissident writer who has been active in preserving historical relics. \"None of them spoke up.\"\nOne of the few people who did speak out was Liang Sicheng, the head of prestigious Qinghua University's construction department in the early days of communist rule.\n\"He was very critical of the development plans,\" said Cheng Zhihua, a professor at the same department at Qinghua today.\n\"But he had little influence because the official media did not publish his views,\" said Cheng.\nWhat Liang had to say was dangerous then, and he was persecuted for his views during the Cultural Revolution, a decade of leftist fanaticism that began in 1965.\nBeijing officials say there is a growing awareness of the need to preserve the past. Some residents say that may be because so much of the city's heritage has already disappeared.\nSome say other factors may also play a role.\nA museum may be built near the wall when it is restored and city planners soon will have another tourist attraction.\n","220":"China's state-run steel companies must trim their bloated payrolls but they are nimble enough to survive in the fiercely competitive marketplace, top officials said on Monday.\nThey also pledged that big steelmakers now preparing to float their shares -- like Anshan Steel and Chongqing Iron and Steel -- would not disappoint shareholders.\n\"We have confidence in the state enterprises in our industry,\" said Liu Qi, minister of Metallurgial Industry. \"They can adapt to market conditions.\"\nLiu and other senior ministry officials told reporters that many companies in the sector had already begun trimming staff and the trend would continue in the years ahead.\n\"We have made a good start to restructuring,\" he said, adding that reforms would continue.\nMany of China's big state industries are grossly overstaffed and unable to compete with more efficient foreign competitors.\nSenior ministry officials said they wanted to see only about 800,000 workers producing steel by the turn of the century. The industry employs 4.5 million people now, but that includes many workers not directly engaged in production as well as those at associated companies.\nLiu said that Anshan Steel, one of three companies cleared late last year to list its shares abroad, had 190,000 employees but only 70,000 were producing steel.\nThe others were at affiliated companies that were operating independently, he said.\nLiu cautioned, however, that many of them would not be out on the street as companies would try to find some form of work for them.\n\"Restructuring does not mean large numbers of people thrown out of work,\" he said.\nLiu said that while steelmakers tried to streamline their operations they were also incorporating new technology to help cut production costs.\nOther officials defended the track record of steel companies that have already offered shares, such as Hong Kong-listed Maanshan Iron and Steel, which has struggled with profits.\n\"Maanshan is a good company with excellent products and equipment,\" said vice minister Wang Wanbin.\n\"Maanshan has had problems but it will achieve better results in future,\" he said, adding that other steelmakers would also perform well in future.\nOther officials said that China's had 107 large and medium-sized steel making companies and that 70 percent of them made were profitable last year.\nThey earned a net 5.1 billion yuan last year with gross profits of 7.4 billion yuan, partly offset by losses of 2.3 billion from those operating in the red.\nThey added that nearly half of the smaller companies were losing money though and that economies of scale had to be raised.\nPanzhihua, a big steelmaker in Sichuan, is also planning to list shares abroad, while Benxi Steel and Hubei Daye Specialty Steel are among those planning offers for foreigners on the domestic B share market.\n","221":"China said on Sunday the United States was trying to contain it and that Washington needed to shift policies to improve ties.\nIn an attack aimed just days before the arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, China also accused the United States of being \"self-righteous\" and \"alientating\" in its foreign policy.\n\"Only when the United States drops the idea of (containing China), removes ideological bias against China and stops basing its foreign policies purely on its own economic interests can we expect significant progress in bilateral ties,\" said the Business Weekly.\nContrary to Washington's stated policy of maintaining contact with China, the United States was employing a strategy of containment based on a security defence chain linking South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and Thailand, said the newspaper, published by the official China Daily.\nThe newspaper was quoting Chen Bingcai, an economist at a think-tank linked to the State Planning Commission.\nThe U.S. secretary of state is scheduled to arrive in China on Tuesay in the first senior-level contact between the two nations since the re-election of U.S. President Bill Clinton.\nIt is part of an effort aimed at repairing relations strained by a series of disputes ranging from Taiwan to human rights to trade and arms proliferation.\nThe most serious damage to ties was inflicted when China held war games and unarmed missile tests off Taiwan early this year, prompting the U.S. to send two aircraft carrier groups near the island in a show of force.\nBeijing has accused the U.S. in the past of pursuing a goal of containment, often linking Washington's policies to what it sees as a revival of Japanese militarism.\nThe newspaper also made the same policy connection, saying that although there had been fewer conflicts with Japan of late, Tokyo still needed to abandon this path.\nChina and Japan have been at loggerheads most recently over disputed East China Sea islands known in Chinese as the Diaoyus and in Japanese as the Senkakus.\nAn expanded U.S.-Japan security pact signed this year was in fact a cover for a resurgence of Japanese militarism, according to the newspaper.\nDiplomats in Beijing said this was a theme heard most frequently from China's armed forces.\nThe newspaper quoted Chen as saying the United States, relying on its economic and military might, was becoming increasingly high handed in international affairs -- \"and its own foreign policy has become extremely self-righteous and alienating\".\nWithout a policy shift, the United States could be expected to continue blocking China's long-stalled entry into the World Trade Organisation and further turbulence was likely in trade and economic relations.\nThe newspaper said the U.S. needed to take into account cultural diferences in handling a range of disputes from the World Trade Organisation to human rights.\n","222":"China's major state banks reported profits last year -- some sharply higher than in 1995 -- and analysts said on Monday this showed they were beginning to act like commercial banks elsewhere.\nFees from credit cards and electronic banking services were drawing in new income while loans were being extended with greater care in limiting risk, they said.\nHowever, the results probably disguised the banking system's huge pile of bad debts from past loans, and writeoffs -- either by the banks or the state itself -- were likely in the years ahead, they said.\n\"The big banks are gradually being turned into real commercial banks and making loans on a commercial basis,\" said an official at the Industrial and Commercial Bank in Shenzhen.\n\"There is a gradual reduction in (lending) risk,\" he said, adding that banks were also cutting costs through electronic payment systems and looking for new sources of income.\nThat view was shared by other Chinese bankers.\n\"There are more controls on lending throughout the banking system,\" said an official with the Everbright Bank.\nChina's banks once were viewed more as the financial arm of the government, extending loans to enterprises that needed funds regardless of whether they would ever repay.\nBanks are now encouraged to make loans that will return a profit while state development banks have been set up to help sectors seen as vital to government interests.\nThe Industrial and Commercial Bank of China -- the bank with the widest exposure in domestic industry -- said its profits surged to 14.5 billion yuan ($1.7 billion) last year from 4.6 billion yuan in 1995.\nThe Bank of China earned 8.2 billion yuan and the China Construction Bank made 2.76 billion yuan, although neither gave comparative figures. The Agricultural Bank said it had a sharp rise in rise in profits in percentage terms.\nBankers said the removal of an interest rate subsidy on long-term deposits and two interest rate cuts during the year fuelled bank profits.\nThe rate cuts not only helped ailing state companies to repay loans that had already been extended but they widened the spread between the cost of funds and the interest earned on loans.\n\"The spread has widened to about three percentage points from less than one point,\" said Beijing University economist Xiao Zhuoji.\n\"This has also helped the state banks.\"\nBut foreign financial specialists said there was still a relatively low return on assets and one of the key concerns was the extent of the bad loans of the past.\n\"No one really knows the extent of the bad debts in the banking system,\" said a foreign financial specialist in Beijing.\nThe U.S. based rating agency Moody's Investors Service said in a report at the weekend that the banks would be insolvent if their loan values were written down to reflect repayment problems, but resolution of the issue would require a complete restructuring of state industry and recapitalistion of the banks.\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)\n","223":"China blamed criminal elements on Sunday for a bomb that ripped through a rush-hour bus on a busy Beijing street, and offered a big reward for help in solving the case.\nExiled Uighur separatists claimed responsibility for Friday's deadly blast, and vowed to stage more attacks until they had gained \"complete freedom\" for China's far western region of Xinjiang.\nLocal Beijing newspapers said in a brief but prominent announcement that \"criminal elements had used a homemade explosive device\" in the attack.\nThe bomb went off on a Number 22 bus as it trundled through Beijing's western Xidan district during the evening rush hour. China's state-controlled media have said no one died but sources said the blast killed at least two people and injured 30.\nThe semi-official China News Service quoted Beijing Mayor Jia Qingling as saying another smaller bomb went off earlier last week elsewhere in the Chinese capital. No one was hurt in that incident.\nThe Beijing blasts followed a string of bus bombings in Urumqi, capital of the restive Moslem region of Xinjiang.\nExiled ethnic Uighurs, who want to set up an independent state of \"East Turkestan\" in Xinjiang, claimed responsibility for those attacks which killed nine people and injured 74.\n\"The bus explosion in Beijing city ...is the only way for the Xinjiang Uighur people to take revenge against communist China's oppression,\" Taiwan's state-run Central News Agency said in a report quoting the Turkey-based Organisation for Turkestan Freedom.\nChina's national media have ignored the bombings in Beijing and Xinjiang.\nOn Sunday, however, local Beijing newspapers published a police notice calling on the public, and passengers on the Number 22 bus in particular, to come forward with any information that could aid the investigation.\n\"Those who provide important information will be given a substantial reward,\" the notice said.\nPolice were unwilling to go beyond the brief official statements. \"We cannot offer any details of progress in the case,\" said one official.\nThe media reports made no mention of a motive.\nThree bombs blew up within minutes of each other on February 25 in Urumqi in attacks apparently timed to coincide with memorial rites in Beijing for China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Deng died on February 19 aged 92.\nBeijing taxi drivers said their employers had warned them last week not to give rides to any suspicious-looking people from Xinjiang and to be especially cautious in areas where many Uighur migrants live.\n\"They said that if we give a Xinjiang person a ride we should check the cab for bombs after he gets out,\" said one taxi driver, who declined to be identified.\nOther sources said a bomb warning had been telephoned to Beijing police before the explosion, but added that the caller had named another area in the capital.\nThose behind the latest bombing may have been trying to make a more dramatic statement with their attack, sources said.\nThe Beijing bus targeted on Friday snakes its way through the Xidan shopping district, then passes the Zhongnanhai compound of China's ruling elite and the vast Tiananmen Square, both of them symbols of communist rule.\n","224":"China said on Thursday the highest-level U.S. visit in two years had produced results and the task now was to push Sino-American ties forward.\nBeijing made the upbeat assessment as U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher wound up a three-day visit by urging China to seize an historic opportunity to build a new era of cooperation.\n\"We believe this visit has produced results,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told reporters.\n\"Both sides believe that Sino-U.S. relations have improved in the last few months,\" he said. \"Both sides believe it is necessary to maintain and develop this improving trend.\"\nChristopher met Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng and held lengthy discussions with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during the visit.\nOne significant gain for Beijing was Washington's willingness to consider cooperation in nuclear technology despite lingering concerns over possible re-exports.\nThe United States and China signed an accord in 1985 for cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear technology. But before the accord can be fully implemented the U.S. president must certify to Congress that Beijing is not providing nuclear assistance to states with unsafeguarded facilities.\nConcerns about assistance to countries such as Iran and Pakistan have long blocked China's access to the technology it wants to spur its nuclear power industry.\nFor its part, China agreed to regular meetings on arms proliferation, though Beijing made clear that as far as it was concerned, the main such issue is U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.\n\"This is the most important arms proliferation issue,\" Cui told reporters.\nChina views Taiwan as a renegade province and it used Christopher's visit to make the point it expects to see an eventual end to American arms sales to the island.\nWashington insists these are two separate issues and it will continue to sell defensive weapons to Taiwan.\nThe foreign ministry spokesman also pointed to results on trade issues, particularly a broad agreement that China should join the World Trade Organisation as soon as possible.\nBut the two sides have different views over how that can be achieved. Beijing wants admission under the more favourable terms of a developing country while Washington insists the Chinese economy is too big for such treatment.\nCui played down other areas of disagreement -- such as human rights -- saying there were major differences between the two sides but these should not become obstacles to improving ties.\nMore high-level contacts were agreed on, though an announcement on summits was deferred, apparently until U.S. President Bill Clinton meets the Chinese president in Manila on Sunday.\nThose talks could touch on possible dates for an exchange of visits by the two leaders.\n","225":"China has tried to put new pressure on Taiwan to boost economic ties, courting the island's businessmen with an announcement of rules on direct shipping links, analysts said on Sunday.\nBut they said Beijing remained far from its goal of securing direct shipping, banned by the rival Nationalist government of Taiwan.\n\"From what we have seen, this already has put some pressure on the Taiwan authorities,\" said Fan Xizhou, head of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University.\n\"This could help stabilise economic ties but more practical steps are needed,\" he said, speaking by telephone from the southeastern port city that would likely benefit from any direct shipping links.\nBeijing, which views the island as a renegade province, unilaterally announced last week a series of regulations on direct shipping links, giving its blue print for future trade.\nTaiwan's Nationalist government has banned direct air and shipping links with China since 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops lost the Chinese civil war to the communists and fled to the island.\nWith tensions easing since the late 1980s, civilian aircraft and vessels have skirted the ban by stopping over in a third country or territory such as the British colony of Hong Kong or Portuguese-run Macau.\nTaiwanese businessmen, who have poured over $20 billion into China, are eager for direct transport links, but Taiwanese authorities have been reluctant to lift the ban.\nThe latest news fuelled hopes among many of Taiwan's businessmen that some of the restrictions might be eased, and it briefly buoyed shipping stocks on the Taipei bourse.\nThe Nationalists, who say they are committed to eventual reunification with China, see direct transport links as their last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.\nChina said that direct shipping would be purely a domestic matter, specifying that only Taiwanese or Chinese companies -- or joint ventures including one side or the other -- would be allowed to conduct business on the routes.\n\"The documents define clearly that direct cargo transport between harbours on the Chinese mainland and Taiwan is regarded as domestic transportation under special management,\" the official Xinhua news agency said.\nThey also make no mention of the role that Taiwan authorities would play, saying only that all companies engaged in the trade would need Beijing's permission.\nTaiwan has set its own formula for future links but it wants to limit the trade to foreign registered companies through a so-called \"offshore\" southern port.\nBeijing's tactics echo those applied to the British colony of Hong Kong, where it has tried to lure companies with substantial business interests in China to do its bidding politically while it engages in political arm-wrestling with the British administration.\nIn Hong Kong, at least, those tactics have been highly successful as many of the same tycoons who once courted the British administration have turned to Beijing to look for economic favours in return for their political support.\nWhether that works with Taiwan remains to be seen.\n\"The new shipping rules were clearly designed to step up the pressure on Taiwan,\" said a Western diplomat.\n\"But if Taiwan doesn't agree, it's all empty talk.\"\n","226":"U.S. computer software giant Microsoft Corp joined China's top personal computer maker on Tuesday in a licensing pact hailed by Beijing as proof it was serious about protecting intellectual property rights.\nUnder the agreement, China's Legend Group will be allowed to pre-install the Chinese-language version of Microsoft's Windows 95 software in its personal computers.\n\"This shows the Chinese government's resolve to protect intellectual property rights,\" said Yu Zhongyu, chief engineer at the Ministry of Electronics Industry, speaking at the signing ceremony in Beijing.\nOther officials at the ceremony described the accord as one of the biggest signed since the United States and China reached an agreement last June on the protection of intellectual property rights, averting a trade war.\nBeijing agreed to protect intellectual property rights by moving to stamp out piracy that American firms had alleged was costing them $2.3 billion a year in lost sales.\nComputer software piracy figured prominently in last year's often heated Sino-U.S. discussions.\nThe licensing pact could mean payments of about 100 million yuan ($12 million) by Legend to Microsoft over the next two years, if the Chinese company meets its sales targets, officials of the two companies said.\nLegend said it sold 200,000 personal computers last year and it is aiming to double that figure this year.\nChinese government officials have said that about 1.8 million personal computers were sold overall in China last year.\n\"This is the most significant agreement Microsoft has signed in the People's Republic of China,\" said Charles Stevens, Microsoft vice president, Far East.\nThe two companies described their agreement as part of a strategic partnership that pointed to further cooperation in future.\nThe Windows 95 software to be installed in the Legend computers employs the simplified Chinese characters used in mainland China.\nLegend Group controls the Hong Kong-listed Legend. Legend officials said the income from the personal computers sold under the agreement with Microsoft would be largely reflected in the results of the Beijing operations.\n","227":"With just 100 days before China regains its coveted prize of Hong Kong, Beijing has sidestepped the colony's departing British masters and made sure new local leaders know where to take their cue.\nChina has made clear its intention to mould the territory's politics more in its own image, mapping plans to dismantle the elected legislature and water down civil liberties laws while telling Britain that objections were pointless.\n\"China is firmly in charge,\" said a Beijing-based diplomat.\nChinese Premier Li Peng has brushed aside London's hopes of monitoring the 1984 Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong after the handover, proclaiming that Beijing would implement the accord as it saw fit.\n\"I think this is unrealistic,\" Li said when asked about British plans to review the pact's implementation after the transfer of power. \"After July 1, Hong Kong's sovereignty returns to China.\"\nUnder the 1984 accord, China has pledged to give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the handover.\nBeijing has also ensured that the future administrators of the territory are firmly in its camp.\nSince his selection by a group of 400 people vetted by Beijing, Hong Kong's leader-in-waiting Tung Chee-hwa has shown little enthusiasm for staking out positions differing from China's official party line.\nBEIJING LIKES WHAT IT HEARS\nThe shipping tycoon-turned-politician, who has shuttled between Hong Kong and Beijing since he was named chief executive-designate last December, has echoed China's views on issues ranging from the territory's future legislature to civil liberties and textbook revisions.\nHe has also hurled barbs at Hong Kong democratic activists who have been critical of China.\nBeijing has responded by showing its pleasure.\nThe official media have described Tung in a somewhat more flattering fashion than that reserved for the territory's current and last colonial governor, Chris Patten, who has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over his efforts to expand democratic institutions in the final years of British rule.\nIn a sign of official favour, cameras of China's national television lingered on Tung when he attended funeral rites last month for late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the man credited with directing the strategy that enabled Beijing to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong.\n\"Mr Tung knows that if he doesn't carry out Beijing's wishes, someone else will,\" said a Western diplomat in Beijing.\nOther analysts in Beijing are willing to wait before making a judgment on Tung.\n\"He has to establish his credibility with the Chinese,\" said a foreign diplomat in Beijing who follows Hong Kong affairs.\nWILL TUNG STAND UP FOR HONG KONG?\n\"The question is, will he stand up for Hong Kong's interests in the future?\"\nSome people are not so sure.\n\"That is the charitable assessment,\" said one foreign diplomat in Hong Kong.\nHe and other analysts suggest that Tung may be more like many of Hong Kong's business leaders who are often reluctant to confront Beijing in public, whatever the issue.\nThe analysts note opposition can be costly.\nJardine Matheson, one of the colony's oldest trading houses, was publicly vilified by Beijing after its directors supported political reforms proposed by Patten. It has since worked hard to mend its relationship.\nBusinessman Jimmy Lai printed vitriolic comments about China's premier in his Next magazine in 1994. Lai's Giordano clothing outlets ran into problems with authorities in China and he eventually sold his share in the firm.\nMany businessmen would probably prefer to see their names linked to more soothing comments to Beijing's ears, such as those of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, on the contribution of China's late leader Deng Xiaoping.\nAn article by Li that was published prominently in the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, praised the late party patriarch, his chosen successor and the future system for Hong Kong, all making deft use of communist jargon.\nBut diplomats said that for political leaders such as Tung, there is a considerable risk in being perceived as too willing to speak out on behalf of Beijing.\nChina wants a popular leader who can rally the territory's 6.4 million people to Beijing's cause, they said.\nIf its interests clash with those of Hong Kong, and Tung is perceived merely as Beijing's willing tool, the future leader risks losing his still high popular support.\n\"China chose him because he was acceptable to many people and would do its bidding,\" said a diplomat. \"If he loses popularity in Hong Kong, that complicates matters for Beijing.\"\n","228":"China's offer to return a hijacker to Taiwan has raised hopes of an easing of tension between the two rivals but it is likely to be only a small step in closing their wide gulf, analysts said on Thursday.\nThey said Beijing has allowed itself flexibility by not saying when it would return the unemployed journalist who is alleged to have commandeered a Taiwan airliner 10 days ago.\nTaiwan, which holds the trump cards in this round of their diplomatic game, may also be trying to use the issue to force a resumption of formal talks with China, broken off in mid-1995.\n\"It's an interesting and encouraging development in that they are still talking to each other on practical matters,\" said a Western diplomat with long years of China experience.\n\"But it's no major concession,\" he said. \"There's likely to be more people hijacking in the opposite direction.\"\nChina on Thursday gave in to Taiwan's demands to repatriate Liu Shan-chung, but demanded the island send back 16 Chinese hijackers in return.\nIt did not give a date for the return of Liu, who is suspected of forcing a Taiwanese airliner to fly to China's southeastern city of Xiamen. The plane, crew and all other passengers were returned the same day but China has held the hijacker in custody.\n\"Liu Shan-chung... will be repatriated to Taiwan after necessary investigations are made,\" the official Xinhua news agency said, quoting China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.\nThe semi-official association handles bilateral ties in the absence of formal links between Beijing and Taipei, rivals since the communists won the Chinese civil war and drove the defeated Nationalists into exile on Taiwan in 1949.\nThe association said China was repatriating the hijacker in line with an agreement reached in 1990, but which was never signed.\nTaiwan has jailed 16 Chinese for hijacking 12 airliners to the island between April 1993 and June 1994. It has offered to return two of them.\n\"Beijing is more eager to see an end to hijackings,\" said another diplomat in Beijing. \"That gives Taiwan leverage on this issue.\"\nTaiwan welcomed Beijing's announcement but declined to signal any further response.\n\"This will be positive for our future talks on hijacker repatriation,\" said Jonathan Liu, a director of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council.\nBut he said Taiwan would wait for formal notification before it decided on its next move.\nTaiwan has banned direct air and shipping with China for almost five decades, and insists such links must go through a third territory, mainly Hong Kong.\nChina has been pushing for direct trade and transport links though Taiwan has been using these as key bargaining chips on any talks on the future relations of the two rivals.\nTaipei wants to see a resumption of semi-official talks, broken off by China after Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui made a private visit to the United States in 1995. The visit angered China, which views the island as a renegade province that is not entitled to official contacts with other states.\nForeign analysts in Beijing said that the timing of the announcement on Liu's return to Taiwan had some additional political mileage for Beijing.\nIt was made shortly before the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, starts a visit to the island.\nChina has warned Taiwan against using the visit to further its political ends.\n","229":"China's central bank, stung by the collapse of a major trust company, is looking warily at the nation's financial system, warning of dangers to Beijing's prestige and social stability.\nThe failure of the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp (CADTIC) because of \"serious illegal and irregular practices\" was deeply embarrassing for China's financial regulators, bankers said.\nBut it was a vindication of sorts for those who have been trying to make the People's Bank of China more like its Western counterparts, boosting the central bank's ability to detect problems in the financial sector, they said.\nThat eventually could help to give it more independence from the nation's political decision-makers, bankers said.\nUnder a three-year, World Bank-sponsored programme, the central bank enlisted the help of big accounting firm Price Waterhouse to strengthen its accounting and supervisory abilities.\n\"They (central bank officials) recognised they had to improve the quality of the information they had,\" said J. Thomas Macy, who headed up the Price Waterhouse team working with the central bank.\n\"You can't make good decisions if you don't have good data,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\nLOANS OFTEN NOT REPAID\nThe People's Bank of China was once seen as merely the financial arm of the government, ensuring that money allocated for lending went to the right place. Whether borrowers ever repaid was less important.\nChina's four, main state-run banks have a combined 134,000 branches and each branch reported to the central bank independently. That gave the central bank a huge flow of uncoordinated and often not very useful information.\nA Western diplomat who viewed such reports piled up at the central bank said he asked a bank employee several years ago what the central bank did with the data and was told earnestly: \"We add the numbers up.\"\n\"The data gave no idea of the state of health of the financial system,\" said Price Waterhouse's Macy.\nThat is clearly changing.\nA computer system was designed for the bank's reporting purposes and a risk-based aproach to financial examination is being introduced.\nMacy said an 800-page examination manual would be given to some 10,000 bank examiners.\nCENTRAL BANK TIGHTENS GRIP ON SECTOR\nChinese bankers say the central bank is already tightening its grip on the financial system.\n\"They are checking much more closely now,\" said a Chinese banker in Shenzhen near Hong Kong. \"They are keeping a close eye on the commercial banks.\"\nMany foreign bankers agree there has been a marked change.\n\"The data collected is getting much better,\" said a Japanese banker.\n\"But more work on technical inspections is needed to bring them (central bank operations) up to international levels,\" he said.\nOthers argue that such skills are not learned overnight.\nBankers said problems similar to those that forced the closure of CADTIC this month still lurk elsewhere in the financial sector. Smaller trust companies set up by regional or local governments are particularly vulnerable.\nCENTRAL BANK SOUNDS ALARM BUT LACKS INDEPENDENCE\nCentral bankers have been sounding the alarm over financial risk, bringing up the theme repeatedly at a recent national banking conference.\nThey pushed home the need for a separation of trust companies -- like CADTIC -- from banks so that banks and their depositors would be insulated from problems at trust firms.\nThey also made their case for keeping bank funds out of the volatile stock and futures markets.\nIf the central bank can demonstrate that it has taken charge of financial supervision it might find it has more room to manoeuvre in the policy-making area, bankers said.\nEconomic issues such as money supply targets -- or even the decision to let foreign banks conduct local currency business -- are highly politicised in China. The central bank ultimately must listen to the views of the State Council, or cabinet.\nWhile this may be politically necessary now, bankers said they would like to see the government give the central bank a vote of confidence by granting it more decision-making authority.\n","230":"A Chinese appeals court, in a rare move, sharply reduced on Friday to five years a prison sentence for an International Monetary Fund (IMF) employee accused of corruption.\nThe court's decision followed a brief suspension of technical assistance by the IMF and a Beijing visit by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus to voice concern over what he described as judicial shortcomings in the case.\nThe Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court sentenced Hong Yang, 44, a Chinese national, to five years in prison for accepting bribes totalling 100,000 yuan ($12,000) in 1993, before he joined the IMF, the Xinhua news agency said.\n\"The sentence was dealt with leniently... and according to law,\" Xinhua quoting the court as saying on Friday.\nHong, a former employee of the People's Bank of China, or central bank, was arrested in December while on an IMF mission to China. He was found guilty on June 28.\nBeijing sources said the original sentence was for 10 years, although statements by the IMF in Washington put it at 11 years. Hong appealed.\nChinese courts rarely cut sentences on appeal, though an admission of guilt may lead to more lenient treatment.\nCamdessus has confirmed reports that Chinese authorities pressured the IMF to include Hong, who had been working at the international organisation's headquarters in Washington, on a mission to China.\nThe Chinese actions created a furore at the IMF and Camdessus said in a letter to the organisation's staff he would closely monitor a second trial.\n\"I also urged that the second open trial be transparent and complete and remedy the shortcomings of the first trial,\" Camdessus said after he visited Beijing last month.\nXinhua did not mention the original trial but it highlighted the legality and openness of the second.\nIt said the case was put on open trial on August 9 and that Hong, his two defence lawyers and four witnesses appeared in court and were involved in the proceedings.\nIt also said that 200 people, including Hong's relatives and IMF officials, were present.\nIt added that the man accused of offering the bribe, Fan Honggen, and other individuals from the Agricultural Bank would be dealt with in a separate case. It did not give further details.\n","231":"China's economic tsar has called for tougher controls on financial risk to protect the nation's banking system and set strict guidelines for trimming its huge pile of bad debt.\nVice Premier Zhu Rongji said state banks, struggling with loans they may never recover, needed to cut bad debt by two percent a year or their top managers could be sacked, the official People's Daily said on Thursday.\n\"The financial system must make a major push in 1997 to restore financial order and reduce risk,\" Zhu told delegates to the nation's parliament.\n\"We must seek to reduce the rate of bad loans by two percent annually over the next few years,\" he said. \"We will hold accountable the leaders of those banks that cannot meet the standards.\"\nZhu, former head of the central bank, has been pushing to insulate banks from speculative investments in real estate as well as the nation's volatile stock and futures markets.\nHe has ordered banks to divorce themselves from trust company subsidiaries that can invest in more speculative markets.\nHe has also pushed hard for banks to extend loans based on the creditworthiness of their customers.\nMany local governments pressure state banks to lend money to key enterprises that are major employers -- even when they are unlikely to repay.\nZhu reminded government officials that the commercial bank law bars local governments from interfering in bank operations.\nCentral bank officials have said as much as 13-14 percent of all loans extended by state-run banks were non-performing.\nSome big banks might be insolvent if their bad loans were written off, financial analysts say.\nIn January, China announced it had shut the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp (CADTIC), major trust firm, for unspecified irregularities.\nOn Thursday, official newspapers reported that the state would stand behind the debts of CADTIC, repaying principal though it would not pay interest.\n","232":"China's Communist leaders may be fretting about the erosion of the ailing state sector at the expense of more nimble private firms.\nBut for one of the nation's newest banks -- the China Minsheng Banking Corporation -- this is an opportunity.\nFormally inaugurated in January, the bank is aiming to lend the bulk of its funds to China's non-state sector, a rapidly expanding area of the economy.\n\"We are focusing our business on the non-state sector,\" chairman Jing Shuping said in an interview. \"Many banks are not looking at this area or are unwilling to lend to it.\"\nMuch of China's creaking state industry is losing money and unable to compete in domestic or export markets. But for now, Communist leaders are unable to shed an ideological albatross, insisting the state retain the leading role in the economy.\n\"The state sector will still play the dominant role but there will be a growing non-state sector,\" said Jing. \"This will be good for the economy and good for us.\"\nChina Minsheng is a non-state entity, founded with the backing of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.\nIt has 59 shareholders, most federation members. Two of the biggest stakes, worth 90 million yuan ($10.8 million) each, are held by diversified Guangzhou Yitong Group and Xiamen Fuxun Group that has interests from real estate to pharmaceuticals.\nThe bank is relatively small by Chinese standards with total capital of 1.38 billion yuan and assets of 5 billion yuan.\nJing says it may not be profitable in its first year due to start-up costs but it aims for a 50 percent return on shareholder capital by the third year of operation.\nBy then, it hopes to have assets of over 10 billion yuan.\nIt differs from many of China's state-run banks that are unable to recover their loans -- made as policy decisions in support of struggling, government-run enterprises.\n\"We have no policy loans,\" said Jing.\nChina Minsheng has extended over 1.0 billion yuan in loans this year -- all on commercial terms.\n\"Most loans are for working capital and not for more than one year,\" he said. \"All have collateral or a guarantee.\"\nThe bank's headquarters are a short walk from the Beijing city government, but Jing said officials do not stroll over to ask for special favours for hard-hit local companies.\n\"They go to the other banks,\" he said. \"The state banks are trying to become commercial banks but they still have to make some policy loans.\"\nBesides its headquarters and an office for international business, China Minsheng has three branches in Beijing. One is in the Haidian district where many high-technology, non-state companies have sprung up -- just the type of customer it wants.\nThe bank cannot lure deposits with higher interest rates since all deposit rates are fixed by the central bank.\nInstead, it must compete in terms of service, staying open longer hours and pumping funds into improving technology by installing computer and automated teller equipment.\nIt has some flexibility on the interest it charges borrowers, though, with a range of 10 percent above or below levels set by the central bank.\nIn the future, China Minsheng will face more competition from foreign banks -- now barred from taking deposits or making loans in Chinese currency.\n\"At the moment, they cannot do local currency business,\" said Jing. \"But that will change.\"\nThe bank is already looking at new areas of business, such as home mortgages, to meet expected demand as China develops a real estate market.\nIt may also want to tap domestic or foreign capital markets to ensure it has the financial muscle to stay competitive.\n\"There could be a movement in this direction in the future,\" Jing said. \"But first we need a good performance over the next three years.\"\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)\n","233":"The Stone Group, a Chinese high technology company, plans to inject assets into its Stone Electronic unit to boost trading in the Hong Kong-listed firm, a top group official said.\nThe asset injections could begin next year as the Hong Kong company recovers from its steep slide in profits in 1995, president Duan Yongji told Reuters.\n\"We want to expand our float,\" Duan said in an interview late on Tuesday.\n\"We don't have enough stock on the market. Many investors say 'you are not big enough',\" he said, adding that more shares would be sold once the assets were injected into the listed vehicle.\nThe plan requires a sharp reduction in the price-to-earnings ratio of the company's stock -- now at about 23 -- to about 10.\nDuan said a sharp rise in earnings expected this year and in 1997 would help to set the stage for the plan.\nThe Beijing-based Stone Group Corp listed shares in 1993 with a HK$300 million ($38 million) flotation for Stone Electronic Technology Ltd.\nThe group still has a controlling 57 percent stake in the Hong Kong company, which makes integrated word processors and printers and distributes a wide range of products, including computers as well as office and lighting equipment.\nStone Group now has 18 joint ventures and it plans to start placing some of those assets into the listed firm.\n\"We are preparing to inject some of the profitable companies into that vehicle,\" Duan said.\nStone Group probably will inject a large part of its 40 percent stake in a $60 million China-based joint venture with Matsushita of Japan to produce light fixtures. The plant has required heavy start-up costs but should be profitable next year, Duan said.\nStone Group also has a stake in a $1.6 billion semiconductor project with Mitsubishi Electric and Mitsui in China, although that will not begin production until late 1997 or early 1998.\nStone, one of the success stories of China's electronics industry, was started with a loan of 20,000 yuan ($2,400) in 1984.\n\"We used to compete with just the little guys,\" said Duan.\n\"That has changed dramatically in recent years,\" he said, adding that all major multi-nationals were now in the domestic market as China has relaxed its once-tight curbs on imports.\n\"Technology is also changing rapidly so we have to make use of our capital,\" the executive said. \"We can't let it stand still.\"\nStone Electronic's profits slumped to HK$17 million in 1995 from HK$63.88 million in 1994. But earnings for the first half of this year were up 44 percent over the year-ago period to HK$10.22 million.\n\"I can't give a profit figure for all of this year but the full year growth will be better than first-half growth,\" Duan said, adding that 1997 should continue that trend.\nStone sees specialised electronic products for the banking system and tax collection as areas where it has major advantages over its competitors.\nThe parent company has also diversified into finance, setting up securities and futures trading operations and investing in a bank. Income from financial operations already has exceeded the company's electronics business.

to Beijing's control, saying it was an internal affair.\nBeijing also angrily reminded Britain that China was no longer a weak, pre-revolutionary government, and said it would not tolerate other countries trying to impose their will on it.\n\"We cannot accept Patten's so-called statement,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said, referring to the governor's criticism of plans to abolish laws on democratic elections and civil liberties in Hong Kong after the transfer of power this year.\n\"I want to remind the British authorities in Hong Kong that the government of China today is not the pre-1949 government,\" he told reporters, referring to the year of the Communist revolution.\n\"We cannot accept any instances of others trying to impose their will on us.\"\nPatten had condemned a move by a China-appointed panel, known as the Preparatory Committee, to draw up a list of 25 laws and articles for repeal or amendment after the transfer of power at midnight on June 30.\nAfter the handover, the territory that has been a British colony for more than 150 years will become a Special Administrative Region of China.\nThe Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Preparatory Committee had the authority to review existing Hong Kong laws to determine whether they were in conflict with the Basic Law, a mini-constitution drafted by China for the territory.\n\"This is entirely an internal matter for China,\" he said.\nShen also tried to play down the impact of the proposals, saying there basically would be no change to existing laws.\nHe called on the Hong Kong government to avoid making statements that \"misled the public or undermined morale in the territory\".\nPatten had said the proposals, made at a committee meeting in Beijing on Sunday, struck at the heart of Hong Kong's civil liberties and appeared to be politically motivated rather than reflecting real inconsistencies with the Basic Law.\nAmong the laws to be diluted are Hong Kong's Bill of Rights, a 1992 election law, the Societies Ordinance which permits the formation of political parties and a 1995 Public Order Ordinance which allows peaceful demonstrations.\n\"Those laws which conflict with the Basic Law cannot continue as laws of the Special Administrative Region,\" Shen said.\nHe said that if the Preparatory Committee recommended the revision or abolition of these laws, it was reasonable and in the interests of a smooth transfer of power.\nThe spokesman also dismissed as groundless concerns over the independence of the judicial system under Chinese rule.\n","235":"U.S. Vice President Al Gore arrived in Beijing on Monday to heal Sino-U.S. ties and pave the way for an exchange of presidential visits amid controversy about possible Chinese efforts to influence U.S. elections.\nGore told reporters before he left Tokyo for Beijing that he would not shy away from issues such as human rights in talks with Chinese leaders during his four-day visit, but had no plans for specific meetings with human rights activists.\nSpeaking after a 24-hour stay in Tokyo Gore said, however, that he could not rule out talks with activists at U.S. embassy functions while he was in China.\nThe controversy over U.S. accusations that China may have made illegal contributions to the Democratic Party cast a cloud over the four-day visit aimed at healing ties damaged by disputes ranging from human rights to trade and Taiwan.\nThe official People's Daily said on Monday the Chinese government had not made any payments to the Democratic Party and that an improvement in Sino-U.S. ties was due to efforts by the two governments and their people.\nAsked what U.S. concerns he would raise in Beijing, Gore replied: \"I will, of course, discuss human rights in my meetings with the leadership of China, nor will it be a surprise to them to hear these matters raised.\"\nBut he added: \"I have no specific meeting of that kind (planned with human rights activists).\"\nHuman rights abuses in China have long been a sore spot in Sino-U.S. relations, particularly since China called in the army to crush a student-led democracy movement in Beijing in 1989.\nGore is the most senior U.S. official to visit China since then President George Bush, who toured China just months before the 1989 crackdown that sent Sino-U.S. ties into a tailspin.\nIn its annual report on human rights, the U.S. State Department accused Beijing of effectively silencing public dissent in 1996 through jailings, intimidation or exile.\nSino-U.S. relations had been strained by disputes ranging from human rights to trade and Taiwan, but Washington and Beijing have worked hard to improve ties in recent months.\nGore's trip to China, part of an Asian tour that includes South Korea, is aimed at paving the way for an exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin over the next year.\nThe sister of China's most prominent dissident has appealed to Gore to ask Beijing to free him from a 14-year jail term when he meets China's leaders on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nThe health of veteran dissident Wei Jingsheng was deteriorating in a Chinese jail and his requests for medical care had been ignored by prison authorities, a U.S.-based human rights group quoted his family as saying after a recent visit.\nIn a letter to Gore, Wei's sister called on the U.S. vice president to use the opportunity of his meetings this week with Chinese leaders to appeal for the release of her brother.\n\"I ask you to appeal to the Chinese government for my brother's prompt release and, until prior to his release, for his parole for medical treatment,\" wrote Wei Shanshan in a letter dated March 4, a copy of which was made available by the New York-based group Human Rights in China.\nAlthough U.S. officials were negotiating with their Chinese counterparts to try to hammer out various agreements in time for Gore's trip, no dramatic breakthroughs are expected.\nIn fact, Gore's advisers had a debate over whether he should even participate in a signing ceremony in which China plans to order new aircraft from Boeing Co, a move that will generate jobs and benefit the U.S. economy.\nAlthough officials said there was no doubt Gore would participate in such an event if a final contract was reached, the fact there was any question underscored the sensitivity of the political funding issue.\n","236":"Farmers near Beijing marked the death of Deng Xiaoping quietly on Thursday, putting the hard task of making a living above memorials for the man whose reforms raised rural incomes dramatically.\nSome people in this rural county in municipal Beijing offered a private word of thanks to China's paramount leader, who helped steer the nation on a pragmatic course until his death at the age of 92 on Wednesday.\nSome shrugged and said they were more concerned with putting food on the family table, while others said they had not even heard the news.\n\"Is it true?\" asked one young man as he unloaded coal from a truck, heaping it beside a small hotel run by farmers who could no longer find work on the land.\n\"I hadn't heard this. It's a great loss for the nation of course, but for me the main concern is making a living,\" he said.\nChinese state media announced Deng's death to the nation early on Thursday.\nDeng, who told his countrymen that to get rich was glorious, may not have made every farmer wealthy but his policies have clearly made life easier for most.\n\"We owe him a debt of gratitude,\" said Shi Huaiqing as he leaned against a tree beside a frozen fishpond and watched his flock graze in a pastoral scene topped by a distant view of the Great Wall.\n\"My life is much better than it was years ago,\" said the 45-year-old, who thanks to policies introduced by Deng can now raise and sell his sheep privately without being branded a traitor to communism.\n\"Before I couldn't sell these sheep on my own,\" he said. \"Now I earn a good living.\"\nDown the road from this village, a 70 year-old retired farmer surnamed Zhao echoed those sentiments.\n\"We are much better off than before,\" he said, smiling a toothless grin as he sifted through a road-side rubbish dump looking for scrap plastic.\n\"In the old days we all ate together and worked together in the production brigades. None of us had any money but now I have enough to get by with a little help from my sons,\" he said.\nThe one-time farmer said that in the 1950s Deng had visited a village not far from where he was standing and had expressed his disgust at the harsh conditions of rural life at that time.\n\"He at least was concerned with our welfare,\" said Zhao.\nBut some people said they were disappointed that incomes had not grown faster and expressed disdain for a surge in corruption unleashed by Deng's economic reforms.\n\"Deng may have been concerned for our welfare, but many local officials still exploit us,\" said a farmer named Du as he sold fruit at a roadside stall near an apple orchard he tended.\n\"The police always come along and chase us away and sometimes throw my apples on the ground,\" Du said.\n\"I may be better off now than I was but it is still hard to make a living,\" he said. \"We still have a long way to go.\"\n","237":"China warned on Monday against reinforcing military alliances, saying Cold War ideology lived on.\nIn an apparent dig at the United States, it also hailed what it called a trend towards a multi-polar political and economic world order.\n\"The practice of reinforcing military alliances runs counter to the current tide of peace and development, and will have to arouse great concern among the people,\" Vice-Premier Qian Qichen was quoted by the official Xinhua news agency as saying.\n\"The Cold War has ended but confrontational 'Cold War thinking' still exists,\" said Qian, who is also foreign minister.\nQian did not name specific targets for Beijing's ire but the remarks closely followed a visit by Premier Li Peng to Russia, a trip that prompted China's official news media to trumpet the rise of a power centre to balance the United States.\nChinese political analysts have noted they shared Russian concerns over the planned expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to admit Moscow's former Cold War allies in eastern Europe.\nChina has also vented its anger at closer U.S. military ties with Japan stemming from an agreement this year that enhanced security ties between the two countries.\nBeijing has tried to strengthen its own links with the United States and other Western countries, but it is keen to see some check on Washington's power, diplomats said.\nQian said a key trend of the past year was the movement towards economic and political \"multi-polarisation\".\nRelations between the world's big powers were undergoing major readjustments, marked by mutual reliance and restraint, which have brought about a complicated and changeable situation, he said.\nThis was underscored by widespread opposition to the Helms-Burton and D'Amato legislation put into effect by the United States with the aim of tightening economic sanctions against Cuba and Iran, he said.\nThe two laws had been strongly condemned and extensively boycotted, Qian said.\nChina sees these laws as U.S. interference in the affairs of other states, a sensitive subject for a country that has come under sharp criticism for its human right policies at home.\nQian said that over the last year, Beijing had moved to counter practices that interfered in its internal affairs, safeguarding the state's sovereignty, territorial integrity and national dignity.\nBeijing was willing to work with the United States to improve ties, adding that relations had stabilised after a \"period of turbulence\" earlier this year.\nSino-U.S. relations were badly strained by Beijing's war games and missile tests near Taiwan in March.\nRelations between Washington and Beijing were also marred by tensions over trade, human rights and arms proliferation although a series of meetings between senior officials helped to ease strains in recent months.\n","238":"China has begun shipping corn from key growing areas in the north to other parts of the country, cutting northern stockpiles in a bid to keep weak prices there from falling further.\nHowever, domestic corn prices, already under pressure, were likely to extend their slide, industry officials said on Tuesday.\nOfficials said last week that permission had been given to ship 1.5 million tonnes of corn from Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces to other parts of the country.\nThe government hopes to push up prices in growing regions to benefit farmers, analysts said. Farmers usually sell their crop close to where it was grown to a middleman, normally a state company, they said.\nSome shipments had already begun, officials said.\n\"These shipments should not have too much of an effect on prices,\" said an official at the information centre of the State Grain Reserve Administration.\n\"Overall there is excess supply and the price of corn is expected to remain under pressure this year,\" he said, adding that weak demand from the domestic feed industry is also contributing to sluggish prices.\nHeilongjiang provincial grain authorities told Reuters by telephone there had been little impact so far on prices in the region.\nDomestic corn prices have slid more than 30 percent since early last year.\nTwo years of bumper harvests and curbs on exports have led to rising stockpiles and falling prices.\nChina has estimated its corn output at 118.5 million tonnes in 1996, up from 106 million in 1995.\nThe China Grains, Oils and feeds newsletter has projected corn production at 122.5 million tonnes this year.\nChina has made public figures of its overall grain reserves but it has not given a breakdown of specific crops.\nThe domestic media have said stockpiles were forcing the state to look for additional space to store excess grain.\nThe China Grains, Oils and Feeds newsletter said market prices in Jilin and Heilongjiang were 1,130 yuan ($136) and 1,050 yuan per tonne, though some analysts say that prices have fallen through the 1,000-yuan level.\nPrices had been around 1,300 to 1,400 yuan per tonne last spring, they said.\nAnalysts said that despite the downward pressure on prices, China was unlikely to remove its controls on exports -- which were imposed in December 1994 on fears of domestic shortages and inflationary pressure.\n\"The main concern is still inflation,\" an analyst said. Even the potential windfall from large-scale exports would not be enough to justify abandoning checks on inflation, although inflation remained largely under control, he added.\nThe State Grain Reserve Administration official agreed.\n\"We are not really looking to make money at this,\" he said in a reference to exports. \"We are just making some small adjustments in the overall picture.\"\nChina exported 150,000 tonnes of corn in the first 11 months of last year, up 36.2 percent from the same period of 1995. The 1995 figures were well below the previous year levels.\nA farm analyst said China's prices were still substantially above world levels and unlikely to interest buyers, even if Beijing decided to relax its stance on exports.\n\"We won't see more than one million tonnes out of China this year,\" he said.\n","239":"Heavy losses in metals trading by a young employee at big Chinese conglomerate CITIC showed striking similarities to Nick Leeson's deals that humbled Barings Bank, a top CITIC official said.\nCITIC -- the China International Trust and Investment Corp -- had learned a bitter lesson from the 1994 losses and had stepped up its internal controls, group executive director Chang Zhenming said in an interview.\n\"There were a lot of similarities,\" Chang said of the CITIC and Barings episodes.\n\"We realised the seriousness of risk,\" he said.\nCITIC has gained a reputation of being one of China's best run companies, expanding its operations to power, telecommunications, banking and real estate. It is probably best known for its Hong Kong-listed unit, CITIC Pacific.\nIts big losses in 1994 were all the more surprising to many foreign businessmen.\nThe key figure in CITIC's trading was Chen Tongsheng, in his early 30's, who worked at the CITIC Shanghai office.\nLike Leeson, who was 28 when his big losses on Singapore's SIMEX exchange emerged, Chen was not a university graduate.\nHe had worked his way through to his trading position, taking a post as a bank clerk after finishing high school.\nAlso like Leeson, he is now in jail -- along with his supervisor, the former president of the Shanghai operation.\n\"Not only was the background of the trader similar (to Leeson) but so were the trading methods as well.\"\nChang said that losses stemmed from unauthorised trades on the London Metals Exchange, and that broker credits compounded the problem.\n\"He didn't have any money. He used LME broker credits,\" said Chang of the Shanghai trader.\nAsked if special accounts were used to hide losses -- as in the Barings case - Chang said: \"You could say it was exactly the same.\"\nAuditors were also unable to make sense of the trading accounts, he added.\nBut unlike Barings, CITIC managed to survive the losses, which were about $40 million compared to Leeson's, which neared $1.4 billion.\nChang said the losses still nearly bankrupted the CITIC Shanghai operations.\n\"We have stepped up our internal controls,\" he said, adding that other prominent cases - such as Sumitomo's copper trading losses -- had been instructive in reducing future risk.\nCITIC's subsidiaries are no longer allowed to conduct operations unrelated to their core activities.\nCITIC has also stopped all commodities trading on foreign markets, in line with a central government directive.\nAsked if the company might return to the market, Chang said this was unlikely in the near future.\n"}}
